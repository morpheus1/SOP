-------------------X1-------------- r/o --------------------X2----------------,
aged about 15 years, herein after referred to as the
prosecutrix, went to the market where a boy named Satvir,
met her and after holding her hand asked her that he
would drop her at her house. She was in the market. She
sat on his motorcycle due to fear of the community (samaj
ki sharam). Accused Satvir instead of taking her to her
house, took her to Faridabad at the house of his maternal
uncle Chanderpal at Village Tale, Faridabad. The parents of
Satvir were also found present there. Satvir kept her there
forcibly up to 09.03.2010. He and his parents pressurized
her for her marriage with Satvir. On 10.03.2010, father of
Satvir took them to a village Badshahpur of District
Faridabad. On 11.03.2010 accused Satvir made physical
relations with her forcibly and when she refused to do so
he threatened her that in case she would raise noise then
he will kidnap her younger sister. On 12.02.2010 father of
Satvir took them to other village whose name she did not
recollect. It was a house of one Raj. She was again beaten
by Satvir. He and his family did not allow her to return to
her house and when she insisted for her return to her
house, they threatened to kill her brother. She was kept
there up to 20.03.2010. In the morning of 21.03.2010 at
about 5 a.m., she escaped from there and returned to her

SC No.129/13                State vs. Satvir & Ors.             Page 2 of 39
 house with many difficulties. Her family members took her
to P.S. When the prosecutrix did not return on 04.03.2010,
her family members including her brother made her search
but they could not found her and ultimately on 08.03.2010,
-----Y----, brother of the prosecutrix reported the matter to
police   and accordingly, FIR        No. 84/10   at P.S.    New

police she was taken to GTB Hospital where her medical
examination was conducted and MLC was prepared.

of the accused persons u/s 313 of the Code was recorded.

them. Accused Satvir admitted that he was son of
Phoolwati and Ram Gopal and that on 07.04.2010 he was

SC No.129/13             State vs. Satvir & Ors.    Page 6 of 39
 taken to GTB Hospital where Dr. Sudhanshu Shekhar
medically examined him vide MLC Ex. PW11/A and that he
also took his samples and that PW15 ASI Brij Pal produced
his date of birth certificate and that he was produced
before Juvenile Justice Board and that as per school record
Ex.PW8/A to Ex.PW8/D his date of birth was 06.09.1990
and that all the material prosecution witnesses correctly
identified him. He denied rest of the evidence and pleaded
that his parents and parents of prosecutrix agreed to
solemnize his marriage with the prosecutrix but it came to
his knowledge that --------X------ was having love affairs with
Sh. Rafi Malik so he refused to marry prosecutrix and due
to that reason he was falsely implicated in the present
case.
12.            Accused Ram Gopal admitted that accused
Satvir is his son. Similar are the statements of       accused
Phoolwati and Chander Pal. They also pleaded that they
agreed to solemnize marriage of accused Satvir with
prosecutrix but they came to know that the prosecutrix
was having love affair with one Rafi Malik so they refused
to marry the prosecutrix with Satvir. Father of the
prosecutrix demanded Rs.1 lac for breaking the marriage
and they did not pay and for that reason they were falsely
implicated. Accused opted to lead evidence in their

SC No.129/13           State vs. Satvir & Ors.     Page 7 of 39
 defence.
13.            In support of their defence accused persons
examined ASI Surender Kumar as DW-1; Vir Singh Gautam
as DW-2 and Inspector Rishi Pal as DW-3.
14.            After closing of evidence by the prosecution and
accused persons, I have heard arguments addressed by Ld.
Additional Public Prosecutor for the State and Ld. Defence
Counsel for accused persons and perused file.
15.            In order to prove its case that accused persons
committed an offence u/s Section 363 IPC, prosecution has
to    prove    firstly,   that   accused       took   or   enticed    the
prosecutrix out of keeping of her lawful guardian; secondly,
that the prosecutrix was a minor that she was under 18
years of age; and thirdly that it was done by the accused
persons without the consent of her guardian.
16.            In order to prove its case that accused persons
committed an offence of kidnapping, abducting or inducing
women to compel marriage, etc. punishable u/s 366 IPC,
prosecution has to prove firstly that the prosecutrix was
kidnapped or abducted by the accused, i.e., accused
persons either by force compelled or by any deceitful

SC No.129/13               State vs. Satvir & Ors.          Page 8 of 39
 means induced the prosecutrix to go from her place and
secondly, the prosecutrix was abducted with the intention
that she may be compelled or knowing it to be likely that
she will be compelled to marry any person against her will
or in order that she may be forced to do illicit intercourse.
17.            In order to prove its case for the offence of rape,
punishable u/s 376 IPC, the prosecution has to prove firstly
that accused Satvir committed sexual intercourse with the
prosecutrix       and   secondly,         sexual        intercourse      was
committed with her by accused Satvir against her will and
without her consent.
18.            It has been argued on behalf of Ld. Additional
Public Prosecutor that prosecution witnesses have proved
all the offences against the accused persons beyond any
reasonable suspicion and shadow of doubt and the
accused persons are liable to be held guilty and convicted
for the said offences.
19.            It has been argued on behalf of Ld. Defence
Counsel that there are various contradictions in the
testimonies of prosecution and prosecution witnesses and
these contradictions come in the category of major
contradictions       and    these      have          created   reasonable

SC No.129/13               State vs. Satvir & Ors.             Page 9 of 39
 suspicion and shadow of doubt in the prosecution case and
accused persons are entitled to get benefited of doubt.
20.            On   the   other    hand,      Ld.   Additional   Public
Prosecutor for the State argued that prosecution witnesses
have proved its case against all the accused persons
beyond reasonable suspicion and doubt. Testimonies of
prosecution witnesses are reliable and trustworthy and
accused are liable to be convicted. She also argued that
minor discrepancies may be ignored in view of the
principles of law laid down in case of State v. Jai Hind, 2012
VI AD (Delhi) 170 wherein it was held that:
21.            On analyzing the evidence on record, I find
contradictions on the following points:
Return of Prosecutrix
22.            Statement of the prosecutrix is silent about the
time of her return at her house on 21.03.2010. Her mother,
PW-6 deposed that the prosecutrix reached at their house
on 21.03.2010 at 5/5.30 PM. Brother of the prosecutrix,
PW-7 deposed that prosecutrix returned back at their
house on 13.03.2010 herself. In cross-examination by
Public Prosecutor for state he admitted the suggestion that
his sister returned to their house on 21.03.2010.
Presence of        prosecutrix    at   ISBT,       Kashmiri     Gate      on
09.03.2010.
23.            Prosecutrix in her statement stated that she was

SC No.129/13             State vs. Satvir & Ors.              Page 11 of 39
 taken by accused Satvir on 04.03.2010 at 5.00 PM and she
was confined in a village Tale, Faridabad in the house of
maternal uncle namely Chander Pal, accused No. 4. She
remained there up to 10.09.2010. Her brother, PW-7
deposed        in    quite   contradiction        by   saying       that   on
05.03.2010 at about 9.00 A.M.,                  he was going to ISBT
Kashmiri Gate area and he saw the prosecutrix with
accused Satvir who was known to him prior to that date. In
cross-examination conducted by Addl. Public Prosecutor he
admitted that he saw prosecutrix on 09.03.2010 at ISBT
Kashmiri       Gate.    In   cross-examination         by     Ld.   defence
counsel he denied the suggestion that he did not see his
sister with the accused on 09.03.2010 at ISBT Kashmiri
Gate, Delhi.
Acquaintance with accused persons.
24.            The     prosecutrix       deposed       that    she     knew
accused Satvir, his father Ram Gopal and his mother Smt.
Phoolwati       on     04.03.2010.       In   cross    examination         she
deposed that she knew accused Satvir one week prior to
the incident. Mother of the prosecutrix, PW-6 deposed that
she did not know accused Satvir and his family members
before the date of incident. His daughter did not tell her
about accused Satvir and his family members before the
date of incident. Brother of prosecutrix, PW-7 deposed
differently by stating that he knew accused Satvir and his

SC No.129/13                 State vs. Satvir & Ors.           Page 12 of 39
 family members for the last 2/3 years before 04.03.2010.
Her mother also knew            accused Satvir and his family
members for the last 2/3 years before the incident. His
sister-prosecutrix also knew accused Satvir and his family
members for the last 2/3 years before the incident. Thus,
all the family members deposed differently regarding
acquaintance with the accused persons prior to the date of
incident.
Love affair between the prosecutrix and accused Satvir
25.            The prosecutrix on this aspect deposed that she
knew accused Satvir one week prior to the incident. He
gave her, his phone number and asked her to phone him.
She    threw      that   telephone        number   and   accused
subsequently, gave that number to her forcibly. She denied
the suggestion that she was having love affair with
accused Satvir. In cross examination she stated that she
did not know whether her marriage with accused Satvir
could not be materialized due to the fact that her affair
with one Ravi Malik came to the knowledge of parents of
accused Satvir. However, she admitted that letter Ex.
PW-2/DA was written by her and it was thumb impressed
by her at point A. On perusal of this document, I find that
it has been mentioned therein that the prosecutrix, in her
full consciousness and understanding, was marrying with


SC No.129/13             State vs. Satvir & Ors.     Page 13 of 39
 accused Satvir. The family members of accused Satvir are
not involved in the marriage and no legal action should be
taken against them and if anything wrong is happened to
them, her family members would be responsible for that.
26.            Mother of the prosecutrix, PW-6 on this aspect
deposed that the prosecutrix did not tell her about the
accused Satvir and his family members before the date of
incident. No decision took place in her house in respect of
accused Satvir before the date of incident about the
marriage of prosecutrix with the                   accused Satvir. She
denied the suggestion that her daughter, prosecutrix was
in love with the accused Satvir.
27.            Brother of the prosecutrix, PW-7 deposed quite
contradictory on this aspect. He stated that there was love
affair between accused Satvir and his sister-prosecutrix
and he came to know about the same after the incident
took place. His sister-prosecutrix told him about her affair
with accused Satvir.
Presence of Ram Gopal and Phoolwati on the place of
occurrence.
28.            PW-2, the prosecutrix on this aspect deposed
that accused Satvir and his parents and his maternal uncle

SC No.129/13             State vs. Satvir & Ors.           Page 14 of 39
 wrongfully confined her at village Tale, Faridabad and
remained there till 10.03.2010. Thereafter, accused Satvir
and his father took her to village Badshahpur, Faridabad.
The IO, PW-15 deposed differently on this aspect. He
stated that parents of accused Satvir were called at Police
Station    twice      for    enquiry       on     10.03.2010     and    on
12.03.2010. On 10.03.2010, they remained present at
police station from 10.00 AM to 12.00 Noon. Thus,
prosecutrix deposed that on 10.03.2010, they were in
village Tale, Faridabad whereas IO deposed that they were
present in police station.
Kidnapping: Age of the prosecutrix
29.            PW-1    Dr.     Ashita     Gulati       deposed   that   on
21.03.2010 he was posted at GTB hospital, Delhi as Senior
Resident and on that day, --------X-------, d/o ----------
X1---------- aged about 15 years female was brought to GTB
Hospital with alleged history of kidnapping on 04.03.2010.
PW-2, on the date of recording of her statement on
08.12.2010, told her age as 15 years. In cross-examination
she stated that she was residing in Delhi for the last 3-4
years and prior to that she was living in her village, Nangla
Katak at Hapur District, Ghaziabad with her maternal uncle
and aunt. She was living there since her childhood and she
studied there upto VIIth class in R.R.K.K Inter College,

SC No.129/13                 State vs. Satvir & Ors.         Page 15 of 39
 Hapur. She took admission in VIIIth class in Ganga Happy
Secondoary School, Jagjit Nagar, New Usmanpur, Delhi in
the year 2008. She did not know her age at the time of her
admission.
30.            PW-8 on this aspect deposed that she had
brought the admission record of -------X-------, d/o --------
X1--------- and according to their record her date of birth
was 20.08.1994. She proved the copy of her admission
form as Ex. PW-8/A. The prosecutrix was admitted in their
school at Serial number 2558 on 14.07.2007 in VIIth class.
Copy of admission register was proved as Ex. PW-8/B. She
was admitted in their school on the basis of T.C. issued by
R.R. K.K. Inter College, Kuchesar Fort, Bulland Shahar, U.P.
The copy of T.C. was proved as Ex. PW-8/C. She issued a
certificate in respect of age of Ms. --------X------- on
13.03.2010 and that was proved as Ex. PW-8/D. In cross-
examination she stated that as per T.C. her date of birth
was 20.08.1994.
31.            Statement of mother of the prosecutrix, PW-6
and brother of prosecutrix PW-7 are silent on the point of
age of the prosecutrix. They did not depose anything in
their examinations in chief. They were not cross-examined
on the aspect of age by Ld. Defence Counsel to elicit

SC No.129/13            State vs. Satvir & Ors.   Page 16 of 39
 information about correct age or date of birth of the
prosecutrix.     I   have     gone      through       above   mentioned
exhibits. The date of alleged incidence is 04.03.2010. On
calculation the age of the prosecutrix as on the date of
incident comes to 15 years 6 months and 14 days. Thus,
prosecutrix was minor on the date of incident.
Kidnapping, Abduction & Wrongful Confinement and
Commission of sexual intercourse with the prosecutrix by
the accused against her will and without her consent.
32.            The prosecutrix PW-2 on those aspect deposed
that she knew the accused Satvir present in the Court as
well her parents Ram Gopal and Smt. Phoolwati. On
04.03.2010 at about 5.00 PM she went to the market near
her house to buy some articles. Accused Satvir met her
there and he caught hold her hand and told that he would
drop her to her house and on his insistence she sat on his
motorcycle but accused Satvir, instead of taking her to her
house, took her to village Tale, Faridabad at the house of
his maternal uncle. Accused Satvir, Ram Gopal, Phoolwati
and   his      maternal     uncle    wrongfully       confined    her     till
10.03.2010 and pressurized her to marry with accused
Satvir. Thereafter, accused Satvir and Ram Gopal took her
to village Badshah Pur in Faridabad. On 11.03.2010,
accused Satvir committed rape on her without her consent.
He also gave beatings to her and threatened to kidnap her

SC No.129/13                State vs. Satvir & Ors.           Page 17 of 39
 younger sister and also threatened to kill her brother if she
protested. Accused Satvir and Ram Gopal took her to
another village at the house of one Raj and confined her
there. On 13.03.2010, accused Satvir left that house and
she was confined there till 20.03.2010. On 21.03.2010, at
about 5.00 AM, she managed to run away from there. In
cross-examination she denied the suggestion that accused
Satvir did not commit rape on her.
33.            PW-1, who medically examined the prosecutrix
deposed that on 21.03.2010, she was posted at GTB
hospital, Delhi as Senior Resident and on that day, the
prosecutrix aged about 15 years female was brought by
lady HC Kulra to GTB Hospital with alleged history of
kidnapping on 04.03.2010 followed by rape on 11.03.2010
by accused Satvir. She medically examined prosecutrix
vide MLC Ex. PW-1/A which was signed by her at point A. In
local examination, she found bruises on the right fore arm
5 cm above wrist joint about 3x2 c.m. She found her
hymen torn, admitted 2 fingers, no bleedings was seen
from edges, and old tears were present. No other external
injury was seen on the body of the prosecutrix. She took
samples and handed over the same to Lady HC Kulara. In
cross-examination she submitted that the prosecutrix was
fully conscious at the time of her medical examination. On

SC No.129/13            State vs. Satvir & Ors.   Page 18 of 39
 perusal of the statement of the prosecutrix recorded by Ld.
MM under Section 164 of the Code, I find that she inter-
alia, stated that on 10.03.2010, she was taken to village
Badshahpur in the night on 11.03.2010. Accused Satvir
made physical relationship with her forcibly and when she
tried to protest, he threatened that if she would make
noise he would kidnap her younger sister. The evidence on
record and particularly discussed herein above has proved
that accused Satvir committed sexual intercourse with the
prosecutrix against her will and without her consent.
Delay in Reporting the incidents
34.            It has been argued on behalf of Ld. defence
Counsel that there is unreasonable delay in reporting the
matter to the police.
35.            On perusal of file, I find that the prosecutrix
deposed        that   she    was     taken      by    the   accused     on
04.03.2010. Brother of the prosecutrix, PW-7 on this aspect
deposed that his sister went missing on 04.03.2010. On
05.03.2010 he informed the police of PS New Usmanpur. In
cross examination he admitted that he lodged the FIR
about the kidnapping of his sister on 08.03.2010 and due
to mistake he told that he lodged FIR on 05.03.2010. PW-3
on this aspect deposed that on 08.03.2010 he was posted

SC No.129/13                State vs. Satvir & Ors.          Page 19 of 39
 at PS New Usmanpur as DO from 4 PM to 12 midnight. --Y--
(PW-7) came at PS and alleged that his sister (PW-2) was
kidnapped by some person and he registered the case
under Section 363 IPC. There is no explanation for not
reporting the matter to the police immediately.
36.            Let us examine and analyze the prosecution
evidence in respect of each of the accused persons.
ACCUSED RAM GOPAL PHOOLWATI AND CHANDER
PAL

37.            After   considering       the        arguments    of     Ld.
Additional Public Prosecutor for the State and Ld. Defence
Counsel and on analyzing the prosecution evidence on
record, I come to the conclusion that prosecution has failed
to prove its case against these accused Ram Gopal,
Phoolwati      and     Chander     Pal   beyond        any   reasonable
suspicion and shadow of doubt. The reasons which support
my conclusion are firstly that the prosecution evidence is
not sufficient to prove all the necessary ingredients of the
alleged offences against them. The prosecutrix, in respect
of these accused deposed that accused Satvir on his
motorcycle took her to village Tale, Faridabad in the house
of his maternal uncle Chander Pal and the accused Ram
Gopal, Phoolwati and Chander Pal wrongfully confined her


SC No.129/13              State vs. Satvir & Ors.            Page 20 of 39
 there and pressurized her to marry with Satvir. She was
confined there till 10.03.2011. Thereafter, Satvir and Ram
Gopal took her to village Badshahpur, Faridabad. On 12.
03.2010 Satvir and Ram Gopal took her to another house
of Raj and she was confined there till 20.03.2010.
38.            PW6   deposed       that      on    21.03.2010     the
prosecutrix came back at their house. She told her that
Satvir asked her to drop at their house but he took her to
Faridabad and she was kept there and his father and
mother were also present there and she was forced to
marry Satvir.
39.            PW7   deposed       that      on    21.03.2010     the
prosecutrix came back at their house and he produced her
in the police station. Testimonies of all other witnesses are
silent about the role of the accused Ram Gopal, Phoolwati
and Chander Pal. Thus, above narrated evidence is the only
evidence against the accused Ram Gopal, Phoolwati and
Chander Pal and in my view this evidence is not adequate
to prove the alleged offences beyond any reasonable
suspicion or shadow of doubt against the accused Ram
Gopal, Phoolwati and Chander Pal.
40.            Secondly, as discussed herein above under the

SC No.129/13             State vs. Satvir & Ors.        Page 21 of 39
 heading, 'presence of the accused Ram Gopal and
Phoolwati on the place of occurrence' the prosecutrix and
IO PW15 deposed differently about the presence of
accused Ram Gopal and Phoolwati. This has also created
reasonable suspicion or shadow of doubt about their role in
commission of alleged offences.
41.            Thirdly, the prosecutrix or any other prosecution
witness has failed to assign any specific role against
accused Phoolwati and Chander Pal for proving the case of
the prosecution that they in furtherance of their common
intention      committed    the    alleged         offences.     In    cross
examination PW2 deposed that Chander Pal did not ask
anything from her when she reached at his house on
04.03.2010.
42.            Fourthly, my attention goes to a case reported
as Sharad Birdhichand Sarda v. State of Maharashtra, AIR
1984 SC 1622, wherein it was inter alia held by Apex court
that:
The principles of law laid down in above case are


SC No.129/13             State vs. Satvir & Ors.               Page 22 of 39
 applicable on the facts of present case in respect of the
accused Ram Gopal, Phoolwati and Chander Pal and
therefore, it is held that these accused are entitled to get
benefit of doubt as in the present case two views, one,
leads to their innocence and another leads to their
involvement in the crime are possible.
43.            Fifthly, the accused have succeeded in creating
doubt in prosecution case so they are entitled to get
benefit of doubt.       My decision finds support by the case
Ajmer Singh and another v. State of Haryana,                    II-1989(1)
Crimes 424, it was held by P&H High Court that:
44.            Lastly, it is one of the basic principles of criminal
jurisprudence that let hundreds of criminal may go
unpunished but one innocent person should not be
punished.       It would be just fair and appropriate, if the
accused Ram Gopal, Phoolwati and Chander Pal are given
benefit of doubt as the prosecution has failed to prove its
case against them beyond any reasonable suspicion and
shadow of doubt.
ACCUSED SATVIR

45.            After   considering      the         arguments     of   Ld.
 Additional Public Prosecutor for the State and Ld. Defence
Counsel and on analyzing the prosecution evidence on
record, I come to the conclusion that prosecution has
successfully proved its case against the Satvir beyond any
reasonable suspicion and shadow of doubt. The reasons
which    support     my     conclusion        are   firstly     that    the
prosecution evidence on record and particularly discussed
herein above is sufficient to prove all the necessary
ingredients of the alleged offences against accused Satvir.
46.            Secondly, the contradictions mentioned herein
above in this judgment are of minor nature. These
contradictions are bound to happen in every case and are
liable to be ignored in view of the principles of law laid
down in case of State v. Jai Hind (supra).
47.            In case of Appabhai and another v. State of
Gujarat, AIR 1988 SC 696, the Apex Court in paragraph 13
observed:
48.            My decision further finds support by a case
Pardeep @ Sonu v. State, 2011 [2] JCC 1031, wherein the
Delhi High Court observed that:
49.            Thirdly,   although      there        is   some     delay     in
reporting the matter to police as the report was lodged on
08.03.2010 inspite of the fact that the prosecutrix was
kidnapped on 04.03.2010 but this delay is liable to be
ignored in view of principles of law laid down in case of
State of Punjab v. Gurmit Singh And Others, 1996 SCC (Cri)


SC No.129/13               State vs. Satvir & Ors.               Page 25 of 39
 316 wherein Apex Court observed that:
50.            Fourthly, in cross examination it was suggested


SC No.129/13             State vs. Satvir & Ors.        Page 26 of 39
 to the prosecutrix that she was having love affair with the
accused Satvir which she denied. It was suggested to the
prosecutrix that she had accompanied with accused Satvir
with her consent which she denied. She reiterated her
reply and denied the suggestion that she went to the
house of Chander Pal herself with Satvir on her free will.
These suggestions have further supported prosecution
case against accused Satvir.
51.            Fifthly, letter PW2/DA, discussed herein above,
instead of providing benefit to the accused Satvir, supports
the case of the prosecution in establishing that the
prosecutrix was kidnapped by him. Even if, arguments of
Ld. Defence counsel to the effect that the prosecutrix went
with the accused Satvir herself, is treated as convincing,
then also it will not provide any benefit to the accused
Satvir because the prosecutrix was minor aged about 15
years 6 moths and 14 days and her consent, if any, has no
relevance.
52.            Sixthly, the arguments of Ld. defence counsel
that the prosecutrix was having affairs with Rafi Malik and
for that reason her marriage could not be solemnised with
accused Satvir is not convincing. Although, in cross
examination, once the prosecutrix admitted that she had a

SC No.129/13             State vs. Satvir & Ors.   Page 27 of 39
 telephonic conversation with one Rafiq, yet that will not
provide any benefit to the accused in creating reasonable
suspicion and shadow of doubt for two reasons firstly, that
the prosecutrix was minor at the relevant time and
secondly, mother of the prosecutrix PW6 has specifically
denied of having any discussion in her house in respect of
marriage of the prosecutrix with accused Satvir in between
04.03.2010 and 21.03.2010. Rather, this has further
supported the case of the prosecution that the alleged
incident of taking away the prosecutrix by accused Satvir,
etc. had taken place.
53.            Seventhly,      not    only      the   mother   of    the
prosecutrix, PW6 but also brother of the prosecutrix PW7
were not cross examined regarding proposal of marriage of
the prosecutrix with accused Satvir. Even, the prosecutrix
PW2 in her cross examination denied the suggestion that
her parents had talk with the parents of accused Satvir for
her marriage with accused Satvir prior to the incident. She
expressed her ignorance for her marriage with accused
Satvir could not be materialised due to the fact that there
was an affair between her and Rafi Malik. This has
established that this plea of Ld. defence counsel is after
thought and not convincing.
 54.            Eighthly, The testimonies of defence witnesses
do not create any reasonable suspicion and shadow of
doubt in prosecution case against accused Satvir. DW1
proved that a complaint was received in the office of DCP
and same was entered in the FAX diary register for the
year 2010 at serial no. 2197 on 15.03.2010 from Ram
Gopal. The photocopy of register was proved as Ex. DW1/A.
This complaint was admittedly filed after the passing over
the period of alleged offences. DW2 stated that a letter
mark 2D/B was delivered to him as he was working as
social worker in Manav Nayay and Anyay Virodhi Sansthan.
On 10.03.2010, he called parents of accused Satvir from
their home and made a telephone call to Satvir and asked
him to come to Delhi as it was informed to him that Satvir
was in Faridabad. On 10.03.2010 accused Satvir arrived at
her house at 04:30 p.m. In cross examination he stated
that he did not know mobile no. of Ram Gopal and he also
did not know if Satvir kidnapped the prosecutrix on
04.03.2010. This testimony of DW2, instead of providing
benefit to the accused Satvir, support the case of the
prosecution in establishing that he was not in Delhi at his
house during the period when alleged incidents had taken
place. DW3 deposed that a person namely Veer Singh did
not produced accused Satvir before him on 10.03.2010
when he was posted at PS Usman Pur. Thus, DW3 has also

SC No.129/13             State vs. Satvir & Ors.   Page 29 of 39
 failed to support the plea of the accused.
55.            Ninthly, the other prosecution witnesses also
supported the prosecution case in respect of accused
Satvir. For example, PW4 stated that she took the
prosecutrix to GTB hospital for her medical examination.
After medical examination, Doctor handed over three
sealed pulanda and she handed over the same to ASI Brij
Pal who seized the same vide seizure memo Ex. PW4/A.
PW5 stated that he took the accused Satvir to GTB hospital
for his medical examination. After medical examination,
Doctor handed over the three sealed pulanda and he
handed over the same to ASI Brij Pal who seized the same
vide seizure memo Ex. PW5/A. PW9 proved the entries Ex.
PW9/A, Ex. PW9/B, Ex. PW9/C and PW9/D of the sealed
pulandas in the Malknana Register and stated that on
21.03.2010 and 07.04.2010 three pulandas on each date
were deposited by ASI Brij Pal in the Malkhana and on
06.05.2010 these pulandas were sent to FSL through Ct.
Satish. PW 10 is the Ld. MM who proved statement of
prosecutrix Ex. PW2/A recorded by him u/s. 164 of the
court. PW11 proved MLC of accused as Ex. PW11/A and
stated that there was nothing to suggest that Satvir was
not able to do sexual intercourse. PW 12 stated that on
06.05.2011, he took the samples and deposited the same

SC No.129/13             State vs. Satvir & Ors.   Page 30 of 39
 to FSL. PW 13 is the witness regarding arrest of accused
Satvir vide arrest memo Ex. PW13/A. PW 15 is the IO who
deposed about the manner in which he conducted
investigation. PW16 is another IO who partly investigated
the case in respect of accused Chander Pal. She also
collected FSL result Ex. PW16/C and Ex. PW16/D.
56.            Tenthly, the prosecution evidence has achieved
the standard of proof of proving its case against the
accused Satvir, as held in a case Ashok Narang v. State,
2012 II AD (Delhi) 481, wherein Delhi High Court has, inter
alia, held that testimony of a single witness in a criminal
trial is acceptable but the evidence must be free of any
blemish or suspicion, must impress the Court as wholly
truthful, and must appear to be natural and so convincing
that the Court has no hesitation in recording a conviction
solely on the basis of the testimony of a single witness.
The offence of rape is a heinous one which carries grave
implications for the accused if convicted. Therefore, the
degree of proof had to be of a high standard and not a
mere possibility of committing the said offence.
57.            Eleventhly, there is no evidence on record
showing any motive or reason for the prosecutrix to
depose against the accused particularly when the accused

SC No.129/13             State vs. Satvir & Ors.   Page 31 of 39
 Satvir was known to her unless he committed the offences.
My view finds support by a case Bharwada Bhoginbhai
Hirjibhai v. State of Gujarat, (SC), 1983 A.I.R. (S.C.) 753,
wherein the Apex Court observed:
Therefore, It is bounden duty of this court to hold accused
Satvir guilty and convict him.
                           CONCLUSION


59.            Consequent upon above reasons, discussion and

SC No.129/13              State vs. Satvir & Ors.      Page 32 of 39
 evidence on record and particularly discussed here in
above, it is held that the prosecution has failed to prove its
case against the accused Ram Gopal, Phoolwati and
Chander Pal beyond any reasonable suspicion or shadow
of doubt that they all or any or more of them in furtherance
of their common intention either kidnapped the prosecutrix
from her lawful guardianship or enticed or took away the
prosecutrix      who was a minor girl, less than 16 years of
age on the date of incident out of keeping of her lawful
guardianship      without   the    consent        of   her     guardian/
complainant or they kidnapped or abducted her to compel
or seduced her to illicit intercourse or wrongfully concealed
or confined her for a period of more than ten days.
Therefore the accused Ram Gopal, Phoolwati and Chander
Pal are entitled to get benefit of doubt. Resultantly, by
giving them benefit of doubt the accused Ram Gopal,
Phoolwati and Chander Pal are acquitted for the offence of
kidnapping       from   lawful      guardianship;        offence         of
kidnapping, abducting or inducing woman to compel
marriage, etc. and offence of wrongful concealment or
confinement        punishable      u/s      363/366/368/34             IPC,
respectively.
60.            However, the accused Ram Gopal, Phoolwati
and Chander Pal are directed to furnish within seven days

SC No.129/13            State vs. Satvir & Ors.              Page 33 of 39
 their personal bond for a sum of Rs.20,000/- with one
surety of like amount as per provisions of Section 437A of
the Code for a period of six months.
61.            It   is   further      held   that    prosecution     has
successfully proved its case against the accused Satvir
beyond any reasonable suspicion or shadow of doubt that
he kidnapped the prosecutrix from her lawful guardianship
and took away the prosecutrix who was a minor girl, less
than 16 years of age on the date of incident out of keeping
of her lawful guardianship without the consent of her
guardian/complainant and he kidnapped her to compel or
seduced her to illicit intercourse and after wrongfully
confining her committed sexual intercourse with her
forcibly   against       her   will    and    without   her   consent.
Resultantly, accused Satvir is held guilty and convicted for
offence of kidnapping from lawful guardianship; offence of
kidnapping, abducting or inducing woman to compel
marriage, etc; offence of wrongful confinement; and
offence of rape punishable u/s 363/366/342/376 IPC. He is
on bail. He is taken in Judicial Custody.Announced in the Open Court

                        ORDER ON SENTENCE
29.08.2013
Present:       Ms. Madhu Arora Addl. P.P. for the State.
               Convict/accused Satvir in J.C.
               Sh. V.K. Azad, Advocate for the convict/
               accused.
               I have heard arguments on the quantum of
sentence and perused file.
2.             It has been argued on behalf of Ld. Defence
Counsel that accused/convict is a first offender; he is
young boy aged about 23 years; his father is heart patient;
and he had been in jail for more than 18 months. It has
been prayed that lenient view in sentence may be taken
and the accused/convict may be awarded sentence less
than the minimum prescribed under the Law as the
prosecutrix was in love with the accused.
3.             In support of his arguments, he relied on a case
Asha Ram vs. State, 1988 (15) DRJ (SN) 76, wherein Delhi
High Court after highlighting the circumstances that the

SC No.129/13              State vs. Satvir & Ors.   Page 35 of 39
 prosecutrix was having plenty of scope for her to get out
the sordid episode, reduced the sentence to 4 years RI with
no fine for the offence punishable u/s 376 IPC. However,
sentence of RI for 3 years u/s 363 was maintained.
4.             Ld. Defence Counsel further relied on a case
Raju vs. State/NCT Of Delhi, 109 (204) DLT 953, wherein
Delhi High Court reduced the sentence to undergo
imprisonment of one year and six months which he had
already undergone observing that prosecutrix was, though
consenting party yet was incapable to give consent as she
was 14-15 years of age.
5.              Ld. Defence Counsel further relied on a case
Iqbal Vs. State of Kerala, AIR 2008 SC 288, wherein the
Apex Court upheld the sentence of 3 years RI for the
offence punishable u/s 376 IPC in a case where there was
consent of the prosecutrix aged about 13 years and 9
months but the consent was having no consequence.
6.              Ld. Defence Counsel further relied on a case
Ram Singh @ Karan vs. State/NCT of Delhi, 1012 92) JCC
1182, wherein Delhi High Court reduced the sentence of 7
years RI to 5 years and 8 months observing that the
prosecutrix, aged about 16 years was in love with the
accused.
7.             On the other hand, it has been argued on behalf
of   Ld.   Additional     Public     Prosecutor    that     deterrent

SC No.129/13             State vs. Satvir & Ors.          Page 36 of 39
 punishment may be awarded to the accused as the
prosecutrix was 15 years old at the time of incident and
she was confined for about 17 days and raped. She further
argued that facts and circumstances of present case and
those cases are different and the above mentioned
findings laid down in said case Law are not applicable in
the present case.
8.             Proviso to Section 376 IPC, which provides
punishment of rape, provides that the court may, for
adequate and special reasons to be mentioned in the
judgment, impose a sentence of imprisonment for a term
of less than 7 years. In the present case the case of the
prosecution was that prosecutrix was taken by the
accused/convict on a motorcycle from a market. The
market was a crowded area. The brother of prosecutrix in
his cross examination deposed that there was love affair
between the accused and his sister the prosecutrix.
Keeping in view these circumstances and principles of Law
laid down in above mentioned cases, I am of the view that
sentence, less than the minimum sentence prescribed u/s
376 IPC, may be imposed in this case.
9.             Accordingly, keeping in view the submissions
and all relevant factors and circumstances in which the
accused committed crime, it would be just, fair and
appropriate      if   lenient    view     in    sentence    is   taken.
 Accordingly,      convict/accused         Satvir    is    sentenced      to
undergo rigorous imprisonment for 4 years and he is
further sentenced to pay a fine of Rs.10,000/- in default
simple imprisonment for 1 year for the offence punishable
under section 363 IPC.
10.            Convict/accused Satvir is further sentenced to
undergo rigorous imprisonment for 5 years and he is
further sentenced to pay a fine of Rs.15,000/- in default
simple imprisonment for 15 months for the offence
punishable under section 366 IPC.
11.            Convict/accused Satvir is further sentenced to
undergo rigorous imprisonment for 6 years and he is
further sentenced to pay a fine of Rs.20,000/- in default
simple imprisonment for 18 months for the offence
punishable under section 376 IPC.
12.            Convict/accused Satvir is further sentenced to
undergo simple imprisonment for 6 months and he is
further sentenced to pay a fine of Rs.2,000/- in default
simple    imprisonment        for    45    days     for    the    offence
punishable under section 342 IPC.
13.            All the sentences will run concurrently.
14.            It is further ordered that if convict/accused
Satvir has undergone any period in judicial custody, that
period will be set off against the sentence as provided U/s
428 Cr. P.C. As per judicial record, the accused had been in

SC No.129/13              State vs. Satvir & Ors.            Page 38 of 39
 JC since 14.3.2010 to 23.8.2011 and 21.8.2013 till date.
15.            Out of the fine amount, and after expiration of
the period of appeal, a sum of Rs.25,000/- will be payable
to    the   prosecutrix      as    compensation.       Besides        this
compensation, she will also be entitled to get other
compensation, if available to her under other laws.
16.            The   convict/accused          Satvir   be     sent      to
imprisonment to serve the sentence.
17.            A copy each of judgment and order on sentence
is supplied to convict/accused Satvir free of cost.
               File be consigned to Record Room.
