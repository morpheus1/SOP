         "To call woman the weaker sex is a libel; it is man's injustice to
         woman. If by strength is meant brute strength, then, indeed, is
         woman less brute than man. If by strength is meant moral power,
         then woman is immeasurably man's superior. Has she not greater
         intuition, is she not more self-sacrificing, has she not greater
         powers of endurance, has she not greater courage? Without her,
         man could not be. If nonviolence is the law of our being, the future
         is with woman. Who can make a more effective appeal to the heart
         than woman?"----Mahatma Gandhi.
1.             Rape is a dark reality in Indian society like in any other nation.
This abnormal conduct is rooted in physical force as well as familiar and
other power which the abuser uses to pressure his victim. Nor is abuse by
known and unknown persons confined to a single political ideology or to
one economic system. It transcends barriers of age, class, language, caste,
community, sex and even family. The only commonality is power which
triggers and feeds rape. Disbelief, denial and cover-up to "preserve the
family reputation" are often then placed above the interests of the victim
and her abuse. Rape is an abominable and ghastly and it worsens and
becomes inhuman and barbaric when the victim is known to the culprit, as
in the present case, who is allegedly subjected to unwanted physical contact
by a perverted male adult on the pretext of promise to marry and whose trust
is betrayed by a man in whom she reposes maximum trust so much so as to
surrender herself before him into a physical relationship and then following
refusal, she is made to undergo a farce of marriage ceremony which neither
is lawful nor valid marriage.

2.             "Courts are expected to show great responsibility while trying
an accused on charges of rape. They must deal with such cases with utmost
sensitivity. The Courts should examine the broader probabilities of a case
and not get swayed by minor contradictions or insignificant discrepancies
in the statement of the witnesses, which are not of a fatal nature to throw
out allegations of rape. This is all the more important because of lately
crime against women in general and rape in particular is on the increase. It
is an irony that while we are celebrating women's rights in all spheres, we
show little or no concern for her honour. It is a sad reflection and we must
emphasize that the courts must deal with rape cases in particular with
utmost sensitivity and appreciate the evidence in totality of the background
of the entire case and not in isolation." The Supreme Court has made the
above observations in the judgment reported as State of Andhra Pradesh
v. Gangula Satya Murthy, JT 1996 (10) SC 550.

especially when it has some variations in the evidence. Mere variance of the
prosecution story with the evidence, in all cases, should not lead to the
conclusion inevitably to reject the prosecution story. Efforts should be
made to find the truth, this is the very object for which the courts are

created. To search it out, the Courts have been removing chaff from the
grain. It has to disperse the suspicious cloud and dust out the smear as all
these things clog the very truth. So long chaff, cloud and dust remains, the
criminals are clothed with this protective layer to receive the benefit of
doubt. So it is a solemn duty of the Courts, not to merely conclude and
leave the case the moment suspicions are created. It is the onerous duty of
the Court within permissible limit to find out the truth. It means, on the
other hand no innocent man should be punished but on the other hand to see
no person committing an offence should get scot-free. If in spite of such
effort suspicion is not dissolved, it remains writ at large, benefit of doubt
has to be created to the accused. For this, one has to comprehend the totality
of facts and the circumstances as spelled out through the evidence,
depending on the facts of each case by testing the credibility of the
witnesses, of course after excluding that part of the evidence which are
vague and uncertain. There is no mathematical formula through which the
truthfulness of the prosecution or a defence case could be concretized. It
would depend upon the evidence of each case including the manner of
deposition and his demeans, clarity, corroboration of witnesses and overall,
the conscience of a Judge evoked by the evidence on record. So the Courts
have to proceed further and make genuine efforts within judicial sphere to
search out the truth and not stop at the threshold of creation of doubt to
confer benefit of doubt.
29.            Under this sphere, I now proceed to test the submissions of both
the sides.

30.            There is no dispute regarding the identity of the accused
Mr.Deepak Dogra who has been identified by the prosecutrix. It is also not
in dispute that they were known to each other prior to the lodging of the
FIR.
AGE OF THE PROSECUTRIX
31.            There is no dispute that the prosecutrix was above 18 years of
age at the time of the incident.
VIRILITY OF THE ACCUSED
32.            The accused has been medically examined by Dr.Ajay Kumar
(PW4) vide MLC (Ex.PW4/B) wherein it is opined that "There is nothing
to suggest that the above person is incapable of performing sexual act)"
33.            This report indicates that the accused is virile and is capable of
performing sexual act and is capable of committing the act of rape.
MLC OF THE PROSECUTRIX AND FSL REPORTS
34.            The MLC of the prosecutrix (Ex.PW4/A) shows that the
absence of hymen and mentions the history of sexual assault 2-2 ½ years
back and is continuing since then.
35.            PW4, Dr.Ajay Kumar has not been cross examined and therefore
his testimony and the MLC of the prosecutrix stand impliedly admitted by

35.            Also the FSL reports (Ex.PW13/A and Ex.PW13/B) also show
that human semen was detected on the underwear of the prosecutix. The
same have not been disputed by the accused and stand impliedly admitted
by the accused.
DEFENCE OF THE ACCUSED
36.            In his statement under section 313 of the Cr.P.C., the accused
has given mainly three word answers by saying "It is incorrect" to most of
the questions or feigning ignorance by saying "I do not know". He has
stated that he is innocent and has been falsely implicated in this case by the
prosecutrix and her father for blackmailing him and to extort money from
him and his family. The father of the prosecutrix, PW10, has not even been
given such a suggestion in his cross examination. Except for a cursory
suggestion to the prosecutrix to the same effect which has been denied by
her, the accused has preferred not to lead any evidence in his defence in
support of his stand.
37.            Therefore, I am of the considered opinion that there is no
veracity in the defence of the accused.
STATEMENT AND EVIDENCE OF THE PROSECUTRIX
38.            It is necessary to discuss and analyse the testimony of the most
material witness i.e. PW1, the prosecutrix.

39.            In the Court, during trial, the prosecutrix, as PW1, in her
evidence, has deposed that has deposed on oath that during the period of
two and half years from the date 06.10.10 at the factory of grandfather of
accused Deepak Dogra situated at Kumar Dhaba Madipur Village, Delhi
called her and took her in a room there and tried to have sexual intercourse
with the prosecutrix and she refused. Deepak told her that he would marry
her. Thereafter, the prosecutrix told Deepak first he should marry her but he
replied that he would marry her after marriage of his sister. Thereafter,
Deepak had sexual intercourse with the prosecutrix without her consent
forcibly. Deepak used to maintain sexual relations with the prosecutrix from
that day onwards sometimes at her house and sometimes at the factory of
his grandfather. This continued for about 2-2 ½ years. Thereafter the
prosecutrix was pregnant by two months at that time from accused Deepak
and accused Deepak told the prosecutrix to get her abortion done and
stopped meeting her. Then she went to PP Madepur on 24.07.2010 and told
the whole incident to the police officials there. Thereafter, the police
officials called accused Deepak and he admitted his guilt there in the
presence of police officials and took her along with him by telling police
officials that he would marry her but after coming out of police post
Madipur, accused refused to marry her and left her at her house. She again
went to PP Madipur probably on 29.07.2010 to complain about accused
Deepak. On 10.08.2010, the accused Deepak and his family members took
her pocket-II, Shiv Mandir, Paschim Puri and there the accused Deepak put
Sindoor in her parting and exchanged garlands but no Saptpadi took place.
Thereafter, accused Deepak and his family members left Mandir after
leaving her in the Mandir and she reached her house. She got so much

harassed by the acts of the accused Deepak and his family members that she
became physically weak and as a result her pregnancy got terminated on its
own. She lodged complaint at PS Punjabi Bagh and her statement
(Ex.PW1/A) was recorded by the police. Accused Deepak had got her
abortion done at one time more prior to this incident. She had also lodged
several complaints before police officials (Ex.PW1/B, C, D and E). Her
statement under section 164 Cr.P.C. (Ex.PW1/F) was recorded. She along
with police office about 2 ½ months thereafter went to the factory of
Deepak near Tikona Park and there on her pointing out accused Deepak was
arrested from the factory vide memo (Ex.PW1/G) and his personal search
was conducted. She identified the undergarments as Ex.P1 and P2
respectively as the same were taken by the doctor at the time of medical
examination.
40.            In her cross examination by the accused, she has deposed that
she had come to Delhi with her Chacha and Chachi (paternal uncle and his
wife) about four years ago (date of evidence is 11.07.2011) and she stayed
with them. Her father stayed there for about two years and they had taken a
rented room in the same house as her Chacha and there were 8-9 rooms in
the house. She stayed with her father in one room which was on the first
floor while her Chacha was in the other room. Her Chacha and father used
to leave at the same time at about 8 am. Her father used to return at about 5
pm. Her Chachi is a housewife. She (prosecutrix) used to leave for her job
in Jai Mata factory situated at Madipur village, whose owner was
Mr.Surender Kumar. Accused used to live at a very short distance from her
house in the same gali (road/street) with his family. She did not disclose

about her affair with the accused to her family members during the entire
period and even to the parents of the accused. She could not tell the name
and address of the factory of the grandfather of the accused nor the number
of persons working in it. She had met/seen the grandfather of the accused
but never talked to him nor had he asked her anything. She was 20 years old
when the affair between her and the accused had started. She had not got
abortion done in any hospital but the accused had brought her pills of
abortion on two occasions. She had lodged 5-6 complaints. She has admitted
to be correct that she knew at the time of her love affair that the accused is
Hindu by religion and she is a Muslim. She did not want to change her
religion. She was not legally married to the accused. She has admitted that
she had put garland on the accused and he had put garland on her. She has
admitted that he had put sindoor on her head. She did not know that there
could not ne a valid marriage until the change of religion. She has admitted
the photographs taken in the temple. After the ceremonies in the temple, she
went to her house. She has denied the numerous suggestions given to her on
behalf of the accused.
41.            In her complaint (Ex.PW1/A), she has leveled allegations
similar to her evidence.
42.            In her statement under section 164 of the Cr.P.C., the
prosecutrix has leveled allegations similar to her evidence that the accused
under the promise to marry her after his sister's marriage developed
physical relations with her and then refused to marry her. She had three
abortions. In order to save himself in a criminal case, he took her to Shiv

temple where her photographs were taken and then she was left outside the

43.            Section 375 of the IPC enumerates six circumstances wherein
the sexual intercourse committed amounts to rape which read as under:
CONSENT OF THE PROSECUTRIX
44.            It has been argued on behalf of the accused that the prosecutrix
was a consenting party.
45.            It may be observed here that consent is an act of reason coupled
with deliberation, after the mind has weighed the good and evil on each side
in a balanced manner. Consent denotes an active will in the mind of a person
to permit the doing of an act complained off. Consent on the part of a
woman, as a defence to an allegation of rape, requires voluntary

participation, not only after the exercise of intelligence, based on the
knowledge of the significance and the moral quality of the act, but after
having freely exercised a choice between resistance and assent.
46.            It is clear from the evidence of the prosecutrix, her complaint
(Ex.PW1/A) as well as her statement under section 164 of the Cr.P.C. that
she has stated all through out that the accused developed physical relations
with her on the promise to marry her after the marriage of his sister. Had he
not so promised, she would not have allowed him to have physical relations
with her.
47.            After the marriage of the sister of the accused, he refused to
marry her and broke his promise on which she was left with no other course
but to make a complaint against him to the police.
48.            Prosecutrix reacted immediately upon coming to know that the
accused has broken his promise to marry her and had been establishing
sexual relations with her on the basis of false promise, implying thereby that
her consent for the sexual act was obtained under a misconception of fact,
thus constituting rape within the meaning of Section 375 IPC.
49.            The veracity of the testimony of the prosecutrix remained
unshattered and unimpeached despite lengthy cross examination. She
deposed that the accused continued to establish sexual relations with her on
the pretext of marriage.

pronoucements has also laid down that the deposition of the prosecutrix in a
rape case is vital and can be relied upon without looking for any
corroboration if the testimony of prosecutrix is otherwise credible and
inspires confidence.
51.            In the case reported as State of Punjab vs. Gurmit Singh &
Ors., AIR 1996 SC 1393(1), the Hon'ble Apex Court observed that
                "Just as a witness who has sustained some injury in the
                occurrence, which is not found to be self inflicted, is considered
                to be a good witness in the sense that he is least likely to shield
                the real culprit, the evidence of a victim of a sexual offence is
                entitled to great weight, absence of corroboration
                notwithstanding.......The courts shoulder a great responsibility
                while trying an accused on charges on rape. They must deal with
                such cases with utmost sensitivity. The courts should examine
                the broader probabilities of a case and not get swayed by minor
                contradictions or insignificant discrepancies in the statement of
                the prosecutrix, which are not of a fatal nature, to throw out an
                otherwise reliable prosecution case. The testimony of the
                prosecutrix must be appreciated in the background of the entire
                case and the trial court must be alive to its responsibility and be
                sensitive while dealing with cases involving sexual
                molestations."
52.            The accused and his counsel have                           relied upon following
judgments in support of the arguments that the offence of rape is not made
out in the facts and circumstances of the present case:

53.            I have carefully perused the same in the facts and circumstances

54.            In its landmark judgment in Uday vs. State of Karnataka, AIR
2003 SC 1639, the Hon'ble Supreme Court observed as under:
55.            In the above referred case the Hon'ble Supreme Court also held
that the consent given by the prosecutrix for sexual intercourse with a
person with whom she is deeply in love, who had promised that he would
marry her at later date cannot be said to be given under a misconception of
fact.
56.            This view of Hon'ble Apex Court was again followed by
Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Deelip Singh @ Dilip Kumar, AIR
2005 SC 2003, where it was held that where prosecutrix was raped with her
consent even before promise to marry was given, consent by victim girl
cannot be said to be given on misconception under Section 90 IPC.

57.            In the case of Manish Kumar Jayant vs. State & Anr.,
2005(3) JCC 1611 the Hon'ble Delhi High Court also relied upon the cases
of Uday and Deelip Singh vs. State of Bihar and observed that the offence
of rape is not made out on the allegations that physical relations developed
between the prosecutrix and the accused out of a love affair and it is only
subsequent to the such relations that the accused had promised to marry her
which remained unfulfilled.
58.            However, in the case of Deelip Singh @ Dilip Kumar, AIR
2005 SC 2003, the Hon'ble High Court further observed that
               "In other words, if the promise to marry the prosecutrix was only
               to seduce the prosecutrix to the sexual act, sexual intercourse on
               consent so derived would be an offence of rape."
59.            Keeping in view the aforesaid observations of the Hon'ble
Superior Courts, it is apparent that where the sexual relations between the
victim and the accused arise out of a love affair and subsequently accused
fails to fulfill his promise to marry the victim, the offence of rape cannot be
said to be made out in such circumstances. However, the present case, in my
opinion, stands on a totally different footing.
60.          A view which is likely to result in vicitimization or exploitation of
innocent girls needs to be avoided and the Courts need to take a view which
would discourage unscrupulous from taking advantage of innocent girls by
alluring them and having physical relations with them on a false promise of
marriage. If a view otherwise is taken, it will amount to putting premium on
the mis-conduct of a men which is not only highly reprehensible and

abhorable but also criminal in nature. If this allowed to happened it will
enable immoral and dishonest persons to exploit girls by alluring them with
a false promise of marriage, pressurizing them to have physical relations
with them by making them believe that they are going to marry them and
there is nothing wrong in having relations with a person who is very soon
going to be her husband and later on turn their back at her in a comfortable
belief that the law being on their side, they can easily get away with their
misdeeds. The Court can not and should not give such a licence to those who
keep on looking for opportunities to exploit the sentiments and vulnerability
of Indian girls who perceive marriage as a pious bonding and not as a union
of two bodies. Allowing such persons to go scott free after exploiting poor
and helpless girls in this manner could not have been the intention of the
legislature which considered rape to be such                 heinous as to attract
imprisonment upto life.( Reliance can be placed upon the judgment of the
Hon'ble Delhi High Court dated 01.02.2010 in Nikhil Parasar versus The

of Bihar & anr.,               Manu/SC/3266/2007, the Hon'ble Supreme Court
observed that a promise to marry without anything more will not give rise to
misconception of fact within the meaning of Section 90, I.P.C., it needs to
be clarified that a representation deliberately made by the accused with a
view to elicit the assent of the victim without having the intention or
inclination to marry her, will vitiate the consent. If on the facts it is
established that at the very inception of the making of promise, the accused
did not really entertain the intention of marrying her and the promise to
marry held out by him was a mere hoax, the consent ostensibly given by the
victim will be of no avail to the accused to exculpate him from the ambit of
Section 375 of the IPC clause second.
64.                The Hon'ble Apex Court in the judgment reported as Yedla

observed that value of consent when obtained under misconception by
playing fraud by the accused by making a false promise to marry which he
never intended to fulfill then such fraudulent consent cannot be said to be a
consent so as to condoned the offence of the accused and such consent was
of no consequence. The act fail in the second category as numerated section
375 of the IPC (sexual intercourse without consent of victim). The
conviction and sentencing of the accused under section 376 IPC were held to
be justified.

65.            The prosecutrix 'K' being a young girl of impressionable age
(she was about 20 years old) was kept under false promise of marriage by
the accused. She deposed before the Court that the accused who was living
in her neighbourhood got acquainted to her and their acquaintance converted
into love. He told her that he loved her very much and tried to have physical
relations with her which she resisted. Then he told her that he would marry
her after the marriage of his sister and had physical relations with her which
he continued for about 2- 2 ½ years. On the assurance that he would marry
her, he raped her. Even after the marriage of his sister, he did not marry her.
On learning that she is pregnant, he told her get an abortion done and
refused to marry her. She went to the police station on 24.07.2010 and gave
her complaint (Ex.PW1/D) where he was called and assured her that he will
marry her on which the prosecutrix mentioned that they have compromised
and he would marry her. But he did not marry her. Then she gave her
complaint on 07.08.2010 (Ex.PW1/C) where again he assured that he will
marry her but did not marry her. Then she gave her complaint to the DCP,
West (Ex.PW1/B) but he did not marry her in a legal and valid manner. On
10.08.2010, she was taken by the accused and his family to Shiv temple
where they exchanged garlands and he put sindoor in her head (which is not
a proper marriage) and photographs of the same were taken.
66.            All these facts indicate that since the beginning of relationship
with the prosecutrix, he did not have any intention to marry her although he
promised to marry her and has only exploited her by having physical
relations with her for about 2- 2 ½ years. Had she known that he would not

marry her, she would not have had any physical relationship with him . Her
so called consent for physical relations is based on misconception and is
neither free nor voluntary and therefore, the same amounts to rape, as
defined under section 375 of the IPC.
67.            It has been argued that there is a discrepancy in the number of
abortions suffered by the prosecutrix in her different statements which
indicates that no offence has been committed. However, I am of the
considered opinion that the accused has not been charged for the offence
under section 313 of the IPC and even the application for the said purpose
by the prosecution had been dismissed vide order dated 01.02.2013, this
contention of the counsel for the accused is of no help to the accused as the
issue is not the number of abortions but whether the prosecutrix was rape
under the garb of promise to marry or whether the physical relationship was
with free consent.
68.            Similarly, the argument made on behalf of the accused that the
prosecutrix as PW1 has deposed that her own family was not aware about
the affair while her father as PW10 has deposed that he was aware about the
same and had seen the accused in his house had objected about and accused
did not pay any attention while his daughter had told him that the accused
would marry her after the marriage of his sister.
69.            Here, it may be observed that a father of a daughter who has
been made to have physical relations under a promise to marry and later
refused would in his anxiety say more than required but it does not wash

70.            It has also been argued that all the details are not mentioned in
the complaints (Ex.PW1/A to E) and this makes the prosecution version
unbelievable. It seems that the same is not tenable as the first complaint was
given by her to the police in haste on 24.07.2010, when the accused refused
to marry her. All the details find mention in her complaint (Ex.PW1/A),
statement recorded under section 164 of the Cr.PC, which was the first
occasion when the prosecutrix gave her statement before the Court of
learned Magistrate and then in her evidence. In my considered opinion, not
much relevance can be attached to the fact that all the details are not
mentioned in the first complaint, in view of the fact that the prosecutrix was
never confronted with the question in her entire cross examination on behalf
of the accused. The fact that the prosecutrix was neither cross examined on
this aspect nor confronted with her complaint in this respect would imply
that the details are not disputed.

               "It is no longer res integra that it is not the requirement of law
               that every minute detail of the occurrence needs to be recorded
               in the FIR. The FIR is not intended to be an encyclopedia of the

               can be culled out is that the omission of material facts

               pertaining to the crime in the FIR is a relevant factor in judging
               the veracity of the evidence of the maker of the FIR but by itself
               is not sufficient to throw the evidence of the said witness. If the
               evidence of said witness is otherwise found to be credible, the
               omission in the FIR is of no consequence."
72.            It has been argued on behalf of the accused that there is a delay
in lodging of the FIR. It may be mentioned here that the period is 2-2 ½
years prior to 06.10.2010 that the accused continued to have sexual relations
with her on the pretext of marrying her after the marriage of his sister. From
her deposition, it is clear that the accused kept on assuring her that he would
marry her only. W.e.f. 24.07.2010 to 06.10.2010 when she was coming to
the police with her complaints that the accused kept assuring her of marriage
and even his family joined in the assurance.
73.            Therefore, upon a complete and careful reading of the evidence
of the prosecutrix, it is revealed that the prosecutrix remained under the
impression that the accused is going to fulfill his promise of marrying her.
Infact, he had no such intention and has only exploited the prosecutix.
74.            Considering the above facts and circumstances of the present
case, the judgments relied upon by accused have no application to the
present case, they being totally distinguishable on facts.
75.            In the present case, it is not the plea of the accused that the
prosecutrix consented to establish sexual relations with the accused as she
was in love with him. Not even a single suggestion to this effect was given

to the prosecutrix during her entire cross examination. Rather, from the
deposition of the prosecutrix, it has been established on record that the
accused established sexual relations with the prosecutrix after keeping her
under a false promise that he would marry her. She continued to have sexual
relations with the accused believing his promise to be true though the
accused apparently made promise to marry the prosecutrix only to seduce
her into the physical relationship and in fact never intended to marry her. In
such circumstances, it is certainly not a case where the consent of the
prosecutrix can be said to be free or voluntary and not based on
misconception.
76.            It is chrystal clear from the unshaterred evidence of the
prosecutrix that the accused during the period of two and half years from the
date 06.10.2010 at the factory of his grandfather called her and took her in a
room there and tried to have sexual intercourse with the prosecutrix and she
refused. He told her that he would marry her. Thereafter, the prosecutrix
told Deepak first he should marry her but he replied that he would marry her
after marriage of his sister. Thereafter, the accused had sexual intercourse
with the prosecutrix without her consent forcibly. The accused used to
maintain sexual relations with the prosecutrix from that day onwards
sometimes at her house and sometimes at the factory of his grandfather.
This continued for about 2-2 ½ years. Thereafter the prosecutrix was
pregnant by two months at that time from the accused and he told her to get
her abortion done and stopped meeting her thereby refusing to marry her.
77.            From the above discussion, it is clear that the evidence of the

prosecution is fully reliable, believable and trustworthy regarding the
veracity of the prosecution case and the prosecution has successfully
established the commission of the offence of rape.
78.            Consequently, in the light of the above discussion, I am of the
opinion that the offence of rape punishable under Section 376 IPC clearly
proved to have been committed by the accused considering the overall facts
and circumstances of the present case. Accordingly, the accused is hereby
convicted for the offence punishable under Section 376 IPC.
SECTION 496 OF THE IPC
79.            Section 496 of the IPC reads as follows:
80.            In the present case, it is alleged against the accused that on
10.08.2010, at Shiv Mandir, Pocket-II, Paschim Vihar with fraudulent
intention, he went through the ceremony of marriage with the prosecutrix
knowing that they are not lawfully married.
81.            Needless to mention here that the accused is a Hindu and the
prosecutrix is a Muslim and the two could not have married unless one of
them converted to the religion of the other or they got married under the
Special Marriage Act.

Under sections 376, 496 and 420 of the Indian Penal Code.
82.            It is clear from the evidence of the prosecutrix that a farce of
marriage ceremony was conducted in the temple by the accused and the
prosecutrix exchanging garlands and the accused putting sindoor on the head
of the prosecutrix (which is also admitted by the accused in his statement
under section 313 of the Cr.P.C.). This indicates that the accused never had
any intention to marry her. Knowing fully well that he is a Hindu and the
prosecutrix is a Muslim and the fact that the marriage cannot be solemnized
without a priest (pandit), the accused went ahead with the farce of the
marriage ceremony even after being told by PW2 that the marriage is not
performed in that temple. He even took photographs to show that he had
married the prosecutrix.
83.            It is clear that neither this farce of marriage ceremony gives it
any legality in the eyes of law or the religions of both the accused and the
prosecutrix nor it is a valid marriage.
84.            It is clear that the accused has committed an offence punishable
under section 496 of the IPC.
MENS REA / MOTIVE
85.            Regarding the motive of crime, it may be observed that in a case
based on circumstantial evidence, the existence of motive assumed
significance though the absence of motive does not necessarily discredit the
prosecution case, if the case stands otherwise established by other
conclusive circumstances and the chain of circumstantial evidence is so

complete and is consistent only with the hypothesis of the guilt of the
accused and inconsistent with the hypothesis of his innocence.
86.            The motive has to be gathered from the surrounding
circumstances and such evidence should from one of the links to the chain
of circumstantial evidence. The proof of motive would only strengthen the
prosecution case and fortify the court in its ultimate conclusion but in the
absence of any connecting evidence or link which would be sufficient in
itself from the face of it, the accused cannot be convicted. Motives of men
are often subjective, submerged and unnameable to easy proof that courts
have to go without clear evidence thereon if other clinching evidence exists.
A motive is indicated to heighten the probability that the offence was
committed by the person who was impelled by the motive but if the crime is
alleged to have been committed for a particular motive, it is relevant to
inquire whether the pattern of the crime fits in which the alleged motive.
87.            In the present case there is sufficient evidence on record to show
that the accused did have a motive to commit the offence. A witness is
normally to be considered independent unless he or she springs from sources
which are likely to be tainted and that usually means unless the witness has
cause, such as enmity against the accused, to wish to implicate him falsely.
Ordinarily a close relation would be the last to screen the real culprit and
falsely implicate an innocent person. It is true, when feelings run high and
there is personal cause for enmity, that there is a tendency to drag in an
innocent person against whom a witness has a grudge along with the guilty,
but foundation must be laid for such a criticism and the mere fact of

relationship far from being a foundation is often a sure guarantee of truth.
However, there can be no sweeping generalization. Each case must be
judged on its own facts. These observations are only made to combat what
is so often put forward in cases as a general rule of prudence. There is no
such general rule. Each case must be limited to and be governed by its own
facts.
88.            In the present case, a story has been projected that the accused
has raped the prosecutrix and this version appears to be true as there is no
reason why he would promise to marry her in order to have physical
relations and then refuse to marry her. Further, the farce of marriage which
he conducted in the temple by exchanging garlands and putting sindoor on
the head of the prosecutrix (which is admitted by the accused in his
statement under section 313 of the Cr.P.C.) alos shows of his ill intention to
marry her. Knowing fully well that he is a Hindu and the prosecutrix is a
Muslim and the fact that the marriage cannot be solemnized without a priest
(pandit), the accused went ahead with the farce of the marriage ceremony
even after being told by PW2 that the marriage is not performed in that
temple. He even took photographs to show that he had married the
prosecutrix. There does appear to be criminal intention and mens rea on the
part of the accused.
INVESTIGATION
89.               The investigation conducted in the present case has been
deposed by PWs 5, 6, 8, 9, 11 (SI Hari Krishan), 11 (ASI Subeydeen) and

13. The FIR has been proved by PW3. The MLCs of the prosecutrix and the
accused have been proved by PW4. The FSL reports have been proved by
PW13. There is nothing on the record which could show that the
investigation has not been conducted properly, fairly and impartially.
90.           The investigation conducted including the documents prepared in
the present case has been substantially proved by the police witnesses
including the first and the second IOs. They have clearly deposed that they
were informed about the rape of the prosecutrix; the accused as well as the
prosecutrix were taken to the hospital for their medical examination;
accused was arrested; documents pertaining to his arrest were prepared;
parcels of the accused and the prosecutrix were seized; medical documents
were prepared; parcels were collected from the doctor and sent to the FSL
for examination; etc. There is nothing on the record to show that their
testimonies are false or not reliable.
91.              It is the actual crime which is important than the investigation.
Where the actual crime is being elaborated and proved in the evidence of
PW1, then the investigation becomes less important as PW1 has not only
deposed regarding the manner of commission of the crime but has also
elaborated all the details and has assigned a clear and specific role to the
accused.
92.            There are two stages in the criminal prosecution. The first
obviously is the commission of the crime and the second is the investigation
conducted regarding the same. In case the investigation is faulty or it has

not been proved in evidence at trial, does it absolve the liability of the
culprit who has committed the offence? The answer is logically in the
negative as any lapse on the part of the investigation does not negate the
offence.
93.             It may also be observed here that the accused has also failed to
show that he is not the person who had raped the prosecutrix under the
promise to marry and made her go through a farce of marriage ceremony
which is not lawful and valid. He has also failed to lead any evidence to
substantiate his claim or falsify the prosecution version or show that the
evidence of the prosecution witnesses is not reliable and credible.
CONCLUSION
94.                            There are two stages in the criminal prosecution.
The first obviously is the commission of the crime and the second is the
investigation conducted regarding the same. In case the investigation is
faulty or it has not been proved in evidence at trial, does it absolve the
liability of the culprit who has committed the offence? The answer is
logically in the negative as any lapse on the part of the investigation does
not negate the offence.
95.            In the case of Sharad Birdhichand Sarda v. State of
Maharastra, AIR 1984 SC 1622, the Apex Court has laid down the tests
which are prerequisites before conviction should be recorded, which are as
under:
       1. The circumstances from which the conclusion of guilt is to be drawn

       should be fully established. The circumstances concerned 'must or
       should' and not 'may be' established;
       2. The facts so established should be consistent onlywith the hypothesis
       of the guilt of the accused, that is to say, they should not be explainable
       on any other hypothesis except that the accused is guilty;
       3. The circumstances should be of conclusive nature and tendency;
       4. They should exclude every possible hypothesis except the one to be
       proved; and
       5. There must be a chain of evidence so complete as not to leave any
       reasonable ground for the conclusion consistent with the innocence of
       the accused and must show that in all human probability the act must
       have been done by the accused.
96.            Applying the above principles of law to the facts of present case,
it is evident that the evidence of the prosecution especially the prosecutrix is
reliable, believable and trustworthy and the prosecution has established the
case of wrongful confinement, rape, threat and simple hurt. The facts of the
case are consistent with the hypothesis of guilt of the accused.
97.            The prosecution has successfully proved that during the period
of two and half years from the date 06.10.2010 at the factory of the
grandfather of the accused at A-Block-733, Madipur Village, Delhi and also
at the house of prosecutrix, the accused Mr.Deepak Dogra had sexual
intercourse with prosecutrix without her free consent under the promise to
marry her and this continued for about 2-2 ½ years.                Secondly, on
10.08.2010, at Shiv Mandir, Pocket-II, Paschim Vihar with fraudulent
intention, he went through the ceremony of marriage with the prosecutrix
knowing that they are not lawfully married.

FIR No. 295/10, Police Station Punjabi Bagh,
Under sections 376, 496 and 420 of the Indian Penal Code.
98.            The prosecution has proved the identity of the accused, the
manner in which the offence has been committed, place of commission of
the offence, the investigation including the documents prepared, MLC, etc.
There is nothing which could shatter the veracity of the prosecution
witnesses or falsify the claim of the prosecution. All the prosecution
witnesses have materially supported the prosecution case and the
testimonies of the prosecution witnesses do not suffer from any infirmity,
inconsistency or contradiction and are consistent and corroborative. The
evidence of the prosecution witnesses is natural and trustworthy and
corroborated by circumstantial evidence and the witnesses of the
prosecution have been able to build up a continuous link. All the facts
relevant in respect of the offences punishable under sections 376 and 496 of
the IPC have been properly proved.
99.            In view of the foregoing reasons, the conscience of this Court
is completely satisfied that the prosecution has been able to successfully
bring home the charge against the accused Mr.Deepak Dogra
regarding the commission of offences punishable under sections 376
and 496 of the IPC.

Court convicting the accused namely Mr.Deepak Dogra for offence

punishable under sections 376 and 496 of the Indian Penal Code (hereinafter
referred to as the IPC), I have heard the Additional Public Prosecutor for the
State as well as the counsel for the convict on the point of quantum of
sentence to be awarded to the convict and also perused the case record.
2.             It has already been observed in the judgment that this case is a
glaring example of the growing menace of sexual abuse. Rape is an
abominable and ghastly and it worsens and becomes inhuman and barbaric
when the victim is subjected to unwanted physical contact by a perverted
male adult who on the assurance and promise to marry had physical
relationship with her and then refused to marry her and further, in order to
save himself, went through a farce of marriage ceremony knowing that the
same is neither lawful nor valid.
3.              "The psychological harm on the victim is massive as it evokes
doubts, raises questions for which answers are not easy to get. The victim
may suppress emotions or be filled with feelings of rage, guilt and shame. It
is difficult for such victims to trust others later on in life. The victim needs
to stand up for himself/herself and not allow the trauma to make them
psychologically and socially weak. Active social support from family,
friends, guidance centres and counselors can bring the victim's faith in the
goodness of human beings back." ---Dr.Sanjay Chugh, Senior Consulting
Psychiatrist.
4.              The victim lacks self-confidence and is always under a sense of
guilt and denial. It's not about the body. It's more about the mind. Sexual

abuse is a rape of the mind and thought processes.
5.          The Additional Public Prosecutor for the State has requested for the
maximum sentence to be imposed upon the convict submitting that he does
not deserve any leniency keeping in view the offence committed by him.
6.          The convict and his counsel, on the other hand, have requested for a
lenient view to be taken against him and for his release on probation as the
convict hails from a modest family. He is an unmarried young man, aged
about 21 years. He was working as an employee in a factory. He lives with
his parents and his father is financially independent. He is in custody w.e.f.
06.10.2010 to 12.10.20111. He is a first offender and has never committed
any offence earlier. It is also submitted that he shall not commit any offence
in future.
7.              Considering the aforesaid submissions from both the sides, the
family circumstances of the convict and perusing the case record, I consider
it proper to award a substantive sentence upon the convict. Rape in itself is
abominable and ghastly and it worsens and becomes inhuman and barbaric
when the convict under the guise of promise to marry the prosecutrix has
violated her person and soul by having physical relationship wfor about 2-2
½ years and then refused to marry her. In order to save himself from a
criminal case, he went through farce of a marriage ceremony also knowing
that the same is neither lawful nor valid. He has subjected the prosecutrix to
unwanted physical contact by a perverted male adult as had she known that
he would not marry her, he would not have surrendered herself to him into a

physical relationship. Her conset was obtained by fraud and on mis-
conception of facts.
8.             Keeping in view the offence committed by the convict, I am not
inclined to take a lenient view against him and release him on probation. He
has raped a young woman who was helpless, defenceless, vulnerable and an
easy prey. He has violated the very sanctity of the relationship between
them.
9.         I am of the considered opinion that the convict should be awarded a
substantive, stern and firm sentence because he has defiled her. As per
social morality which attaches highest importance to the chastity of a
woman, the outrage and breach of her privacy and modesty is a heinous
offence. Keeping into consideration the fact that the act of rape is an act of a
perverted man, the minimum sentence provided of seven years or a lesser
imprisonment should not be awarded to the convict. I do not find any
mitigating factors. The


10.          The object of sentence should be to protect the society and to deter
the criminal in achieving the avowed object to law by imposing appropriate
sentence. The Courts are expected to operate the sentencing system so as to
impose such sentence which reflects the conscience of the society and
sentencing process has to be stern where it should be. To show mercy in the
case of such a heinous crime would be a travesty of justice and the plea
for leniency is wholly misplaced. The welfare and interest of other women
in the society also needs to be protected for the reason that if the convict is

released, they may be subjected by him in a similar offence with them.
11.         It has been held in the judgment reported as State of Karnataka v.
Raju, 2007 (11) SCC 490, as follows:
12.            Undue sympathy to impose inadequate sentence would do more
harm to the justice system to undermine the public confidence in the
efficacy of law and society could not long endure under such serious
threats.

       facts and circumstances bearing on the question of sentence and
       proceed to impose a sentence commensurate with the gravity of the
       offence. Courts must hear the loud cry for justice by the society in
       cases of heinous crime of rape on innocent helpless girls of tender
       years, and respond by imposition of proper sentence. Public
       abhorrence of the crime needs reflection through imposition of

Subhra Chakraborty, AIR 1996 SC 922, the Hon'ble Apex Court
observed that:"
15.           In the present case, the convict has committed rape on a pregnant
young woman. Due to her medical condition and the threat extended to her
by the convict, she was in a position to offer much resistance to the convict.
The convict has taken advantage of a helpless and defenceless vulnerable
prey. She must have undergone immense physical pain and agony when the
offence was committed. The convict went on to commit the ghastly,
abominable, inhuman and barbaric act of rape, violating her person and
giving her a lifelong trauma.

innocent girls needs to be avoided and the Courts need to take a view which
would discourage unscrupulous from taking advantage of innocent girls by
alluring them and having physical relations with them on a false promise of
marriage. If a view otherwise is taken, it will amount to putting premium on
the mis-conduct of a men which is not only highly reprehensible and
abhorable but also criminal in nature. If this allowed to happened it will
enable immoral and dishonest persons to exploit girls by alluring them with
a false promise of marriage, pressurizing them to have physical relations
with them by making them believe that they are going to marry them and
there is nothing wrong in having relations with a person who is very soon
going to be her husband and later on turn their back at her in a comfortable
belief that the law being on their side, they can easily get away with their
misdeeds. The Court can not and should not give such a licence to those who
keep on looking for opportunities to exploit the sentiments and vulnerability
of Indian girls who perceive marriage as a pious bonding and not as a union
of two bodies. Allowing such persons to go scott free after exploiting poor
and helpless girls in this manner could not have been the intention of the
legislature which considered rape to be such                 heinous as to attract
imprisonment upto life.( Reliance can be placed upon the judgment of the
Hon'ble Delhi High Court dated 01.02.2010 in Nikhil Parasar versus The
State Govt NCT Of Delhi in bail application no.1745/2009.)


17.             Sexual violence apart from the being a dehumanizing act is an
unlawful intrusion on the right of privacy and sanctity of a female. It is a
serious blow to her supreme honour and offends her self-esteem and dignity.

It degrades and humiliates the victim and leaves behind a traumatic
experience. A rapist not only causes physical injuries but more indelibly
leaves a scar on the most cherished possession of a woman i.e. her dignity,
honour, reputation and not the least her chastity. Rape is not only a crime
against the person of a woman, it is a crime against the entire society. It
destroys the entire psychology of a woman and pushes her into deep
emotional crisis. It is a crime against basic human rights, and is also
violative of the victim's most cherished of the Fundamental Rights, namely,
the Right to Life contained in Article 21 of the Constitution of India, 1950
(in short the Constitution) the Courts, are therefore, expected to deal with
cases of sexual crime against women with utmost sensitivity. Such cases
need to be dealt with sternly and severely. A society sensitized judge is a
better statutory armour in cases of crime against women than long clauses of
penal provisions, containing complex exceptions and provisions (Reliance
can be placed upon 2004 IX AD (S.C.) 5 and Shri Bodhisattwa Gautam
v. Miss Subhra Chakraborty (AIR 1996 SC 922).
18.           Recently, crime against women generally and rape in particular is
on the increase and the society also appears to be concerned for the honour
of women. In this backdrop, this Court is required to treat the issue with
more sensitivity. The object of sentence is not only required to be
reformative but it should also be punitive, preventive and deterrent. The
offences against women are on a rise and there is an urgent need to curb this
tendency by awarding deterrent punishment to perpetrators of this grave
offence.

19.            In the present case, the act of the convict is most deplorable, both
legally and morally. It is time for realization that certain category of
sexually depraved behaviour is totally unacceptable in the Indian Socio-
Legal System which seeks to protect the chastity the first virtue of a woman
and such behaviour can prove to be costly as has happened in the present
case. The victim is a young woman who reposed trust in the convict and on
his promise to marry him surrendered before him into a physical
relationship which lasted for about 2-2 ½ years. Then the convict shattered
her faith and trust in him and refused to marry her. When she approached
the police, he went through a farce of marriage ceremony which neither is
lawful nor valid.
20.              Keeping in view the ghastly and inhuman act of the convict, a
substantive and stern sentence is required to be imposed upon the convict so
that it is not only in commensuration with the gravity of the crime but also
serves as an example for the others who might also venture on the same
forbidden path. The convict does not deserve any leniency.
21.                            Therefore, considering these aggravating facts, I
hereby sentence Mr.Deepak Dogra, the convict as follows:
                50,000/- in default of payment of which, he shall undergo
                rigorous imprisonment for a period of one year; and
           2. for offence under section 496 of the IPC to rigorous
                imprisonment for a period of seven years and a fine in the

deposited in a fixed deposit, in terms of Rule 7 of the Scheme, in a
nationalized bank for a period of three years and the remaining 25 % shall
be available for utilization and initial expenses by the victim/prosecutrix.
