investigation   of   this   case   was   handed   over   to   her.   The   prosecutrix   and   the

was got recorded U/s 164 Cr.PC.  The exhibits of the case were sent to FSL and 

he has proved the site plan as Ex. PW17/C and has collected the FSL result 

which are Ex. PX and PY.  
5.               Ld. counsel for the accused has argued that the accused has been 

falsely implicated in the case.   The prosecutrix was in love with the accused 

and has gone with the accused with her own free consent.   The age of the 

prosecutrix was more than 18 years on the date of alleged incident.  There is no 

evidence on record to prove that the accused has kidnapped the prosecutrix and 

has raped the prosecutrix.   On these grounds, it is prayed that the accused be 

acquitted.   
                 On the other hand, Ld. APP has argued that from the evidence on 

record, the prosecution has proved its case beyond reasonable doubt against the 

accused. 
6.               The case of the prosecution is that on the date of alleged incident 

i.e. 26.7.11, the prosecutrix was aged about 16 years.  PW2, the prosecutrix has 

been examined in the court on 10.7.12 and has deposed her age as 16 years and 

that   her   brother   Pradeep   had   got   her   admitted   in   the   first   class   at   Village 

Sakipur, UP.  Pradeep got recorded her date of birth in the school.  She do not 

know her date of birth.  

SC No. 46/13                                                                           Page 8of 13
                                               9

                Pradeep has been examined as PW7.  He has deposed that he do 

not know who got the prosecutrix admitted in the first class.  The date of birth 

of the prosecutrix is 15.12.1996.   His date of birth is 28.12.1982.   He is 10 

years elder to the prosecutrix. 
                PW6   Shri   Chander   Bhan,   the   father   of   the   prosecutrix   has 

deposed that on 26.7.11, the prosecutrix was aged about 15 years.  

                PW9 Shri Raj Kumar Mishra who is the Principal of the school 

has deposed that the prosecutrix took the admission in their school on 25.7.07 

and as per the school record, the date of birth of the prosecutrix is 16.8.1996. 

He has also deposed that the document 'mark A' which is certificate alleged to 

be issued on behalf of the Head Master of the school is fake document.   The 

document 'mark A' showing the date of the prosecutrix as 15.12.96, has been 

handed over by the father of the prosecutrix to the police.   

                In my view, the school record does not show correct date of birth 

of the prosecutrix as she has deposed that her date of birth has been mentioned 

in the school record by PW7, but PW7 has deposed that he do not know who 

had got her admitted in the school. He has also deposed that the date of birth of 

the prosecutrix is 15.12.1996 but as per the school record, it is 16.8.96. 

                The evidence of PW7 also shows that the prosecutrix has been 

born    in  the  year  1992  as he has  deposed  that he is  ten  years  elder  to  the 

prosecutrix and has deposed his date of birth as 28.12.82.  

                The prosecutrix has deposed that she do not remember her date of 

birth   but   has   also   deposed   that   greeting   card   Ex.   PW2/DA   and   letter   Ex. 



SC No. 46/13                                                                      Page 9of 13
                                                  10

PW2/DB has been sent by her to the accused through her friend in the year 

2002.  If the date of birth of the prosecutrix is taken as 1996 then  in the year 

2002,   the   age   of   the   prosecutrix   comes   to   be   6   years.     Perusal   of   the   Ex. 

PW2/DA and Ex. PW2/DB shows that a girl of six years does not achieve such 

maturity to write such documents.  
                 In view of the above discussions, I am of the opinion that the 

prosecution has failed to prove that the prosecutrix was aged about 16 years on 

the date of alleged commission of offence.   However, from the testimony of 

PW7, it is proved that the prosecutrix was more than 18 years on the date of 

alleged commission of offence.
6.               PW2 has deposed that on 26.7.11, her father had given beatings 

and thereafter she called the accused. The accused asked her to accompain him 

as he would take her to the house of her another bhabhi living in village Dutt 

Nagar.   The accused instead of taking to village Dutt Nagar   took her to the 

house of one of his friends at Sangam Vihar, Delhi.  She along with the accused 

stayed in that house for about 10 days.  The accused had maintained physical 

relation with her against her will in that house. PW2 has denied the suggestion 

of  the  accused  that the   accused   has  physical relationship   with   her  with   her 

consent. 
                 It has been observed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in AIR 2004 

Supreme Court 1497 as follows:
                          "It is well settled  that a prosecutrix  complaining of  

        having been a victim of the offence of rape is not an accomplice  



SC No. 46/13                                                                          Page 10of 13
                                              11

      after the crime. There is no rule of law that her testimony cannot be  

      acted without corroboration in material particulars. She stands at a  

      higher pedestal than an injured witness. In the latter case, there is  

      injury on the physical form while in the former it is both physical as  

      well as psychological and emotional. However, if the Court of facts  

      finds it difficult to accept the version of the prosecutrix on its face  

      value, it may search for evidence, direct or circumstantial, which  

      would   lend   assurance   to   her   testimony.   Assurance,   short   of  

      corroboration as understood in the context of an accomplice would  

      suffice."
               It has been observed by Hon'ble Supreme Court in 2005 VIII AD 

(S.C.) 328 as follows:

               The defence of the accused is that PW2 has physical relation with 

the accused with her consent.   PW2 has been cross examined by the accused 

but no material has been come on record to support his defence.  The accused 

has also not led any  evidence in his defence.   The testimony of PW2 is reliable 

and inspire confidence to prove the fact that the accused has committed rape 


SC No. 46/13                                                                     Page 12of 13

with her. 
7.             In view of the above discussions, as the prosecution has failed to 

prove that the prosecutrix was below 18 years of age on the date of incident, so 

no offence U/s 363 IPC   stands proved against the accused.   However, the 

prosecution has proved its case beyond reasonable doubt against the accused 

U/s 376 IPC.  Accordingly, the accused is convicted U/s 376 IPC.
