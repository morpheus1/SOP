1.      At the outset, it may be mentioned that this case was decided in
fourteen days of its transfer to this Court of Additional Sessions Judge
(Special Fast Track Court)-01, West, Tis Hazari Courts, Delhi i.e. on
09.01.2013 and the judgment has been delivered on 23.01.2013.
2.      Rape is a dark reality in Indian society like in any other nation.
This abnormal conduct is rooted in physical force as well as familiar and
other power which the abuser uses to pressure his victim. Nor is abuse by
known and unknown persons confined to a single political ideology or to
one economic system. It transcends barriers of age, class, language, caste,
community, sex and even family. The only commonality is power which
triggers and feeds rape. Disbelief, denial and cover-up to "preserve the
family reputation" are often then placed above the interests of the victim
and her abuse. (Reliance on the material on the internet). Rape is an
abominable and ghastly and it worsens and becomes inhuman and
barbaric when the accused is in fiduciary relationship with the victim (as
in the present case since the accused is addressed as "Mama-maternal
uncle" of the husband of the prosecutrix), who is subjected to unwanted
physical contact by a perverted male adult.
3.               "Courts are expected to show great responsibility while
trying an accused on charges of rape. They must deal with such cases
with utmost sensitivity. The Courts should examine the broader
probabilities of a case and not get swayed by minor contradictions or

insignificant discrepancies in the statement of the witnesses, which are
not of a fatal nature to throw out allegations of rape. This is all the more
important because of lately crime against women in general and rape in
particular is on the increase. It is an irony that while we are celebrating
women's rights in all spheres, we show little or no concern for her
honour. It is a sad reflection and we must emphasize that the courts must
deal with rape cases in particular with utmost sensitivity and appreciate
the evidence in totality of the background of the entire case and not in
isolation." The Supreme Court has made the above observations in the
judgment reported as State of Andhra Pradesh v. Gangula Satya
Murthy, JT 1996 (10) SC 550.

uncontroverted and unrebutted and can be presumed to have been
admitted as correct by the accused.
DISCUSSION, ANALYSIS AND OBSERVATIONS
31.              The question is how to test the veracity of the prosecution
story especially when it has some variations in the evidence. Mere
variance of the prosecution story with the evidence, in all cases, should
not lead to the conclusion inevitably to reject the prosecution story.
Efforts should be made to find the truth, this is the very object for which
the courts are created. To search it out, the Courts have been removing
chaff from the grain. It has to disperse the suspicious cloud and dust out
the smear as all these things clog the very truth. So long chaff, cloud and
dust remains, the criminals are clothed with this protective layer to
receive the benefit of doubt. So it is a solemn duty of the Courts, not to
merely conclude and leave the case the moment suspicions are created. It
is the onerous duty of the Court within permissible limit to find out the
truth. It means, on the other hand no innocent man should be punished
but on the other hand to see no person committing an offence should get
scot-free. If in spite of such effort suspicion is not dissolved, it remains
writ at large, benefit of doubt has to be created to the accused. For this,
one has to comprehend the totality of facts and the circumstances as
spelled out through the evidence, depending on the facts of each case by
testing the credibility of the witnesses, of course after excluding that part
of the evidence which are vague and uncertain. There is no mathematical
formula through which the truthfulness of the prosecution or a defence

case could be concretized. It would depend upon the evidence of each
case including the manner of deposition and his demeans, clarity,
corroboration of witnesses and overall, the conscience of a Judge evoked
by the evidence on record. So the Courts have to proceed further and
make genuine efforts within judicial sphere to search out the truth and not
stop at the threshold of creation of doubt to confer benefit of doubt.
32.              Under this sphere, I now proceed to test the submissions of
both the sides.
DEFENCE OF THE ACCUSED
33.                   The accused has claimed in his defence that he has been
falsely implicated in this case. In his statement under section 313 of the
Cr.P.C., recorded on 17.01.2013, the accused has claimed that he has been
falsely implicated in this case at the instance of prosecutrix and her
husband since the husband of the prosecutrix had borrowed a sum of Rs.
50,000/- from him and to avoid to returning the amount, he has been
falsely implicated in this case. His brother in law, Mr.Banwari Lal
(Behnoi) had given him Rs.50,000/- which he had given to the husband
of the prosecutrix. His brother in law and sister have since expired.
Accused has preferred not to lead any evidence in his defence.
34.              However, the accused has not led any evidence in his
defence to substantiate his claim. Even the suggestions he has given to
the prosecutrix are different to the extent that he has suggested to the

prosecutrix that the accused has been falsely implicated at the instance of
her husband as her husband did not want to return the borrowed amount
of Rs.50,000/- while to the husband of the prosecutrix, it has been
suggested that he has been falsely implicated when the accused
demanded his Rs.50,000/- from PW4 then PW4 and his wife falsely
implicated him in this case. It has also been suggested to PW4 that he
had taken Rs.50,000/- from the accused on the pretext to marry the
prosecutrix with the accused. These facts indicate that he is putting up a
false defence on an after thought. The accused has only attempted
unsuccessfully to mislead the Court.
35.              The accused has also failed to show any motive or malafide
intention on the part of the prosecutrix and her husband for implicating
him in a false case. The accused failed to assign any malafide motive to
PWs 3 and 4 that they would get him falsely implicated in a rape case.
The defence of the accused does not appear to be probable.
IDENTITY OF THE ACCUSED
36.              There is no dispute regarding the identity of the accused. He
has been named in the FIR.
37.              It may be observed here that the parties were known to each
other even prior to the incident and therefore, there can be no question of
doubt being raised with regard to the identity of the accused who has also

been correctly identified in the Court by the prosecutrix (PW3) and her
husband (PW4).
STATEMENT OF THE PROSECUTRIX
38.              The Additional Public Prosecutor has argued that the
evidence of the prosecutrix does not suffer from any inconsistency and is
blemish free while the amicus curiae for the accused has argued that no
reliance can be placed upon her evidence as there are many variations.
39.              It may be observed here that it is a general handicap attached
to all eye witnesses, if they fail to speak with precision their evidence
would be assailed as vague and evasive, on the contrary if the speak to all
events very well and correctly their evidence becomes vulnerable to be
attacked as tutored. Both approaches are dogmatic and fraught with lack
of pragmatism. The testimony of a witness should be viewed with broad
angles.      It should not be weighed in golden scales, but with cogent
standards. In a particular case an eyewitness may be able to narrate the
incident with all details without mistake if the occurrence had made an
imprint on the canvas of his mind in the sequence in which it occurred.
He may be a person whose capacity for absorption and retention of events
is stronger than another person. It should be remembered that what he
witness was not something that happens usually but a very exceptional
one so far as he is concerned. If he reproduces it in the same sequence as
it registered in his mind, the testimony cannot be dubbed as artificial on
that score alone.           Similar observations have also been made by the
Sessions Case Number : 105 of 2012.

FIR Number 105 of 2012; Police Station Uttam Nagar.

Supreme Court in the judgment reported as Bhag Singh and Oths. v.
State of Punjab, 1997 VII AD SC 507.
40.              When an eye witness is examined at length it is quite
possible for him to make some discrepancies. No true witness can
possibly escape from making some discrepant details. Perhaps an untrue
witness who is well tutored can successfully made his testimony totally
non-discrepant. But Courts should bear in mind that it is only when
discrepancies in evidence of witness are so incompatible with the
credibility of his version that the Court is justified in jettisoning his
evidence. But too serious a view to be adopted on mere variations falling
in the narration of incident (either as between the evidence of two
witnesses or as between two statements of the same witness) is an
unrealistic approach for judicial scrutiny.
41.              However, I find that the prosecutrix, in her evidence before
the Court as well as her statement to the police, is consistent with regard
to the role of the accused and the manner in which he committed the
offence by raping her twice on the same day. She has categorically
deposed that on 03.03.2012, after her husband left for his work at about
9.00 am and she was alone in the house at that time. At about 10.00 am,
accused Mr.Ramjee Lal came to her house, asking for her husband and
bolted the door of the room from inside and pressed her mouth with her
hand (smothered). Thereafter, he forcibly made her lie on the bed sheet
already spread on the floor of the room. She raised alarm saying that she

would tell her husband about the same on which he threatened to kill her.
She got scared and remained mum. The accused raped her and then left
the house. Out of fear of the accused, she did not narrate the incident to
anyone as he had threatened to kill her. On the same day, he came again
at about 2 pm when she was alone in the house. She had taken a bath and
was changing clothes in the room. Accused bolted the room from inside.
On seeing him, she told him that she will narrate everything to her
husband on which the accused slapped her. Thereafter, he again forcibly
made her lie on the same bed sheet already spread on the floor and
committed rape upon her. When she said that she will tell about the
incident to her husband, he slapped her and threatened to kill her. At
about 3 pm, he left her room. Due to the threatening by the accused, she
did tell the incident to any neighbor. When her husband returned from
work at about 9 pm, she told him about the incident. At the time of
incident she was one month pregnant.
42.              It has been argued on behalf of the accused that the
prosecutrix could have raised alarm and called the neighbours but I am of
the considered opinion that it is not unusual for neighbours to be
oblivious to the happenings in the adjoining quarters. It is to be noted
that in the present case victim was facing sexual assault by a known
person and in these circumstances there could be hardly in struggle when
the accused has threatened the victim and beaten her as soon after the
incident.

Under sections 342/506/376 of the Indian Penal Code.
43.              It has also been argued on behalf of the accused that it is not
possible to commit rape upon the prosecutrix while the neighbours were
also in the viscinity. However, I am of the opinion that this contention is
not tenable especially in view of the testimony of PW3 when she has
deposed that the accused had bolted the door from inside, there was no
occasion for the neighbours to notice anything unusual.
44.              The contention of the advocate, amicus curie for the accused
that the details of the incidents of morning and evening have not been
furnished by the prosecutrix also does not hold any force as much
importance cannot be given to this contention as it must be remembered
that the shock of this defilement must have been so great and she must
have been overtaken by the trauma of the incident, she cannot be
expected to know exactly what was happening around her and what were
the exact details. Even otherwise, she has given all the details which are
necessary to constitute the offence.
45.              Nothing material has come forth in her lengthy cross
examination on behalf of the accused. It has not been controverted that at
the time of incident, she was one month pregnant and on the date of
evidence she has a seven months pregnancy and her eighth month is
running. The police visited her house and the site plan (Ex.PW3/B) was
prepared. One saree, one blouse and petticoat (underskirt) which she was
wearing at the time of incident of 10 am and one salwar which she was
wearing at the time of incident of about 3 pm, one bedsheet and one towel

were given to the doctor. Even this fact has not been controverted. All the
material aspects of the offence have also not been controverted and
rebutted.
46.              The evidence of the prosecutrix has been most inconsistent
in so far as the allegations against the accused are concerned, on the
following aspects:
       9.Due to the threatening by the accused, she did tell the incident to
       any neighbor. When her husband returned from work at about 9

FIR Number 105 of 2012; Police Station Uttam Nagar.
Under sections 342/506/376 of the Indian Penal Code.
47.              On behalf of the accused, it has been vehemently argued that
in her statement before the court, the prosecutrix has improved upon her
earlier statement regarding the name of her husband being asked by the
accused on coming to her house at about 10 am. In this regard, it may be
observed that a valid explanation is forthcoming for the same as the fact
that he was asking for her husband (without his name) is mentioned.
48.              It is apparently clear from the above that the allegations are
specific and consistent. There is no reason why the accused would have
been falsely implicated. It is also evident that the prosecutrix is a married
woman and had a one month pregnancy at the time of incident. She could
have suppressed the incident without any person having come to know of
it, which she did not do and rather chose to inform her husband about the
same on which the present case was registered and there is no reason for
her why she would expose herself to this situation under the given
scenario. No plausible explanation is forthcoming on behalf of the
accused as to why the prosecutrix would falsely implicated him. Rather,
the only defence of the accused is that the husband of the prosecutrix had
borrowed Rs.50,000/- from him and to avoid returning, the accused has
been falsely implicated in this case. This defence remains unsubstantiated
due to lack of evidence. The explanation of the accused is highly
improbable. No person worth the name would expose his wife to this kind
of allegation only to avoid repaying the alleged borrowed amount. The

defence so raised by the accused is neither probable nor acceptable. There
is no reason to disbelieve of what the prosecutrix has stated.
49.              It has been argued that the prosecutrix had made false
allegations of rape against the accused since there were sufficient
opportunities for the prosecutrix to have raised an alarm as a large
number of persons are staying in the area and the testimony of the
prosecutrix cannot be relied upon. It may be observed that in this regard
the prosecutrix has explained her circumstances and has specifically
deposed that due to fear she could not say anything and she told her
husband on his return.
50.              The manner in which the events have unfolded and the
surrounding circumstances, reflect the truthful character of the deposition
made by the prosecutrix.
51.              No Indian woman would put her reputation to stake by
making false allegations against a man outside the marriage nor any
Indian male would expose his wife to come up with such an allegation
against his distant relative only for not returning the borrowed amount.
Reliance can be placed upon the judgment of the hon'ble Supreme Court
of India reported as Om Prakash v. State of Uttar Pradesh, AIR 2006
SC 2214 wherein the following observations were made:
       ".... The Indian women has tendency to conceal such offence (of
       rape) because it involves her prestige as well as prestige of her

Unique Case ID Number : 02401R0269992012 .
FIR Number 105 of 2012; Police Station Uttam Nagar.

       family. Only in few cases, the victim girl or the family members has
       courage to go before the police station and lodge a case. In the
       instance case the suggestion given on behalf of the defence that the
       victim has falsely implicated the accused does not appeal to
       reasoning. There was no apparent reason for a married woman to
       falsely implicate the accused after staking her own prestige and
       honour......"
52.               The Courts must, while evaluating evidence, remain alive to
the fact that in a case of rape, no self respecting woman would come
forward in a Court just to make a humiliating statement against her
honour such as is involved in the commission of rape on her. In cases
involving sexual molestation, supposed considerations which have no
material effect on the veracity of the prosecution case or even
discrepancies in the statement of the prosecutrix should not, unless the
discrepancies are such which are of fatal nature, be allowed to throw out
an otherwise reliable prosecution case. The inherent bashfulness of the
females and the tendency to conceal outrage of sexual aggression are
factors which the Courts should not overlook.
53.               The contention of the accused that there is only the evidence
of the prosecutrix against him without any corroborative evidence, I am
of the considered view that in criminal trial, the finding of conviction can
be based even on the strength of deposition of single witness, in case it is
found trust worthy and reliable as it is quality and not quantity of the
evidence that count and my view is strengthened by the judgment of the
Supreme Court of India, in the case reported as Sheelam Ramesh and

another v. State of A.P., JT 1999 (8) S.C. 537, wherein it is observed
that Courts are concerned with the quality and not quantity of evidence
and in a criminal trial, conviction can be based on a sole evidence of a
witness, if it inspire confidence.
54.             There is nothing on the record to indicate that the evidence of
the prosecutrix is false or motivated. Her evidence appears to be
completely reliable and trustworthy.
CONSENT OF THE PROSECUTRIX
55.     Consent is an act of reason coupled with deliberation, after the
mind has weighed the good and evil on each side in a balanced manner.
Consent denotes an active will in the mind of a person to permit the doing
of an act complained off. Consent on the part of a woman, as a defence to
an allegation of rape, requires voluntary participation, not only after the
exercise of intelligence, based on the knowledge of the significance and
the moral quality of the act, but after having freely exercised a choice
between resistance and assent.
56.              It has been held in the judgment reported as Sadashiv
Ramrao Hadbe v. State of Maharashtra and another, (2006) 10 SCC
92 that absence of injuries on the body of the prosecutrix improbabilise
the prosecution version that she has been raped. Similar opinion was also
observed in Radhu v. State of Madhya Pradesh, JT 2007 (11) SC 91
and Vinay Krishna Ghattak v. State of Rajasthan, 2004 (1) RCR
Sessions Case Number : 105 of 2012.

Under sections 342/506/376 of the Indian Penal Code.
(Cri.) 565 wherein it was held that absence of injuries on the body of the
prosecutrix generally gives rise to an inference that she was a consenting
party.
57.              In the present case, no plea has been raised that the
prosecutrix (who has injuries) was consenting party as the incident, as
such, has been denied by the accused.
58.              Section 114 A of the Indian Evidence Act provides that in a
prosecution for rape under sub section 2 of Section 376 of the Indian
Penal Code where sexual intercourse by the accused is proved and the
question is whether it was without the consent of the woman alleged to
have been raped and she states in her evidence before the court that she
did not consent, the Court shall presume that she did not consent.
59.              Applying the settled principles of law to the facts of the
present case it is evident that the prosecutrix has all through been very
consistent in her testimony and stated that she had not consented to any
kind of relations with the accused.
60.              Therefore, under these circumstances, I hold that once the
prosecutrix has stated that she did not consent, there is no reason to
disbelieve her statement.

Under sections 342/506/376 of the Indian Penal Code.
61.              Further, the husband of the prosecutrix (PW4) has deposed
that when he returned in the night, he was told by the prosecutrix about
the incident. It is a case where the accused had committed the act upon
the prosecutrix without her consent and it was for this reason that she
informed her husband about the same. It is unbelievable that the
prosecutrix would have told her husband about the entire details in case if
she was a consenting party to the act and therefore, her testimony to that
extent is liable to be believed and the accused is unable to successfully
rebut the presumption in favour of the prosecutrix.
62.              The manner in which the events have unfolded and the
surrounding circumstances, reflect the truthful character of the deposition
made by the prosecutrix.
THREATS AND BEATING BY THE ACCUSED
63.               In her testimony before the Court, the prosecutrix has stated
that she had been threatened by the accused that he shall kill her and her
husband. He has beaten her when he had come in the afternoon when he
again committed the rape. The argument that the details of the threats and
beatings are not given is not tenable as due to suddenness of the offence,
the mental faculty of such a victim cannot be expected to be attuned to
observe the details like the words used in the threats, the exact place of
beatings, etc.. The deposition regarding the threat and beating is also
consistent.

64.            It has been argued on behalf of the accused that the husband of
the prosecutrix as PW4 made several improvements from his statement
under section 161 of the Cr.P.C.
65.           On careful perusal of the evidence of PW4, it transpires that his
evidence is corroborative to the evidence of PW3, the prosecutrix, on
material points that she had told him about the incident on his return at
night.
66.              In the judgment reported as, State of H.P. v. Lekhraj and
another, JT 1999 (9) SC 43, it was observed by the Supreme Court of
India as under :-
67.                  In the judgment reported as, Surender Singh v. State of
Haryana, JT 2006 (1) SC 645, it was observed by the Supreme Court of
India as under :-
       "It is well-established principle of law that every discrepancy in

Sessions Case Number : 105 of 2012.
Unique Case ID Number : 02401R0269992012 .
FIR Number 105 of 2012; Police Station Uttam Nagar.
Under sections 342/506/376 of the Indian Penal Code.
       the witness statement cannot be treated as a fatal to the
       prosecution case. The discrepancy, which does not affect the
       prosecution case materially, does not create infirmity."
68.              The Supreme Court had an opportunity to guide as to why
discrepancies arise in the statements of witnesses. In the judgment
reported as Bharwada Boginbhai Hijri Bhai v. State of Gujarat, 1983
(CRI) GJX 0252 SC, the Supreme Court pointed out the following
reasons as to why the discrepancies, contradictions and improvements
occur in the testimonies of the witnesses.
  (a)By and large a witness cannot be expected to possess a photographic
  memory and to recall the details of an incident. It is not as if a video
  tape is replayed on the mental screen.
  (b)Ordinarily it so happens that a witness is overtaken by events. The
  witness could not have anticipated the occurrence which so often has
  an element of surprise. The mental faculties therefore cannot be
  expected to be attuned to absorb the details.
  (c)The powers of observation differ from person to person. What one
  may notice, another may not. An object or movement might emboss its
  image on one person's mind, whereas it might go unnoticed on the part
  of another.
  (d)By and large people cannot accurately recall a conversation and
  reproduce the very words used by them or heard by them. They can only
  recall the main purport of the conversation. It is unrealistic to expect a
  witness to be a human tape recorder.
  (e)In regard to exact time of an incident, or the time duration of an
  occurrence, usually people make their estimates by guess work on the
  spur of the moment at the time of interrogation. And one cannot expect
  people to make very precise or reliable estimates in such matters.
  Again, it depends on the time sense of individuals which varies from
  person to person.
  (f)Ordinarily a witness cannot be expected to recall accurately the
  sequence of events which take place in rapid succession or in a short

Sessions Case Number : 105 of 2012.

  time span. A witness is liable to get confused, or mixed up when
  interrogated lateron.
  (g)A witness, though wholly truthful, is liable to be overawed by the
  court atmosphere and the piercing cross-examination made by counsel
  and out of nervousness mix up facts, get confused regarding sequence of
  events, of fill up details from imagination on the spur of the moment.
  The subconscious mind of the witness sometimes so operates on
  account of the fear of looking foolish or being disbelieved through the
  witness is giving a truthful and honest account of the occurrence
  witnessed by him perhaps it is a sort of psychological defence
  mechanism activated on the moment.
69.           As far as minor inconsistencies or improvements are concerned
in the statement of PW4 it can be said that minor variations in the
accounts of a witness are often the hallmark of the truth of his testimony.
When the discrepancies were comparatively of minor character and did
not go to the root of the prosecution story, they need not be given undue
importance. Mere congruity or consistency is not the sole test of truth in
the deposition. In the depositions of witnesses there are always normal
discrepancy, however, honest and truthful they may be. Such
discrepancies are due to normal errors of observation, normal errors of
memory due to lapse of time, due to mental disposition such as shock
and horror at the time of occurrence, and the like. Material discrepancies
are those which are not normal, and not expected of a normal person.
70.            Therefore, there is no reason to throw out the testimony of the
husband of the prosecutrix.

71.              The MLC of the prosecutrix (Ex.PW5/A) has been duly
proved by Dr.Preeti Bhaduria (PW5) and Dr.Manoj (PW6).
72.              Her examination has revealed that she has multiple linear
superficial abrasions on forearm and wrist and this fact corroborates the
evidence of the prosecutrix that she received scratches on her hand while
resisting the accused.
73.              The prosecutrix is a married woman and her medical
examination revealed that the hymen is old torn which is very natural sine
since was married about two years earlier to the incident and was one
month pregnant.
74.              The FSL reports (Ex.PW13/A and Ex.PW13/B)                   also
indicate that human semen was detected on the cervical swab, cervical
slide, vaginal swab, vaginal slide, one dirty salwar, one dirty petticoat,
one dirty bedsheet, one dirty towel and one dirty underwear. There is
nothing to suggest that the reports are not genuine.
75.              The presence of semen on the above mentioned exhibits, all
pertaining to the prosecutrix, show that physical relationship has been
made with her.

76.              The MLC of the accused (Ex.PW8/A) is proved by
Dr.Avnish Bhargava (PW8) and it is clear from the same that there is
nothing to suggest that the accused cannot do the sexual act.
77.               The medical and forensic evidence is corroborative to the
evidence of the prosecutrix.
INVESTIGATION
78.              The investigation conducted in the present case has been
deposed by PWs 1,7, 9, 10, 11 and 12. The FIR has been proved by PW2.
The MLCs of the prosecutrix have been proved by PWs 5 and 6. The
MLC of the accused been proved by PW8. The FSL reports have been
proved by PW13. There is nothing on the record which could show that
the investigation has not been conducted properly, fairly and impartially.
79.           The investigation conducted including the documents prepared
in the present case has been substantially proved by the police witnesses
including the first and the second IOs. They have clearly deposed that
they were informed about the rape of the prosecutrix, the accused as well
as the prosecutrix were taken to the hospital for their medical
examination, accused was arrested, documents pertaining to his arrest
were prepared, underclothes of the accused and the prosecutrix were
seized, medical documents were preaped, parcels were collected from the
doctor and sent to the FSL for examination, etc. There is nothing on the
record to show that their testimonies are false or not reliable.

80.             It is the actual crime which is important than the investigation.
Where the actual crime is being elaborated and proved in the evidence of
PW1, then the investigation becomes less important as PW1 has not only
deposed regarding the manner of commission of the crime but has also
elaborated all the details and has assigned a clear and specific role to the
accused.
81.              There are two stages in the criminal prosecution. The first
obviously is the commission of the crime and the second is the
investigation conducted regarding the same. In case the investigation is
faulty or it has not been proved in evidence at trial, does it absolve the
liability of the culprit who has committed the offence? The answer is
logically in the negative as any lapse on the part of the investigation does
not negate the offence.
82.            It may also be observed here that the accused has also failed to
show that he is not the person who had confined, raped, threatened and
beaten the prosecutrix. He has also failed to lead any evidence to
substantiate his claim or falsify the prosecution version or show that the
evidence of the prosecution witnesses is not reliable and credible.
CONCLUSION
83.              It is clear from the above discussion that the prosecution has
been able to successfully prove that on 03.03.2012 between 10.00 am to

he committed rape upon prosecutrix (name withheld to protect her
identity) at her house by confining her wrongfully in her room by bolting
the room from inside and both the times after committing rape upon
prosecutrix, he criminally intimidated prosecutrix that he would kill her
and her husband, if she told the incident to her husband and he had
slapped/beaten her.
84.     In the case of Sharad Birdhichand Sarda v. State of
Maharastra, AIR 1984 SC 1622, the Apex Court has laid down the tests
which are prerequisites before conviction should be recorded, which are
as under:
85.              Applying the above principles of law to the facts of present
case, it is evident that the evidence of the prosecution especially the

prosecutrix is reliable, believable and trustworthy and the prosecution has
established the case of wrongful confinement, rape, threat and simple
hurt. The facts of the case are consistent with the hypothesis of guilt of
the accused.
86.              The prosecution has proved the identity of the accused, the
manner in which the offence has been committed, place of commission of
the offence, the investigation including the documents prepared, MLC,
etc. There is nothing which could shatter the veracity of the prosecution
witnesses or falsify the claim of the prosecution. All the prosecution
witnesses have materially supported the prosecution case and the
testimonies of the prosecution witnesses do not suffer from any infirmity,
inconsistency or contradiction and are consistent and corroborative. The
evidence of the prosecution witnesses is natural and trustworthy and
corroborated by circumstantial evidence and the witnesses of the
prosecution have been able to build up a continuous link. The only fact
which the prosecution has not been able to prove is that the accused had
knowledge that the prosecutrix was pregnant at the time of incident. Rest
all the facts relevant in respect of the offences punishable under sections
376, 342, 506 and 323 of the IPC have been properly proved.
87.                In view of the foregoing reasons, the conscience of this
Court is completely satisfied that the prosecution has been able to
successfully bring home the charge against the accused Mr.Ramjee
Lal regarding the commission of offences under sections 342, 376, 506

FIR Number 105 of 2012; Police Station Uttam Nagar.
Under sections 342/506/376 of the Indian Penal Code.
1.      In pursuance of judgment dated 23.01.2013 as passed by this Court
convicting the accused namely Mr.Ramjee Lal for offence punishable
under sections 342, 376, 506 and 323 of the Indian Penal Code
(hereinafter referred to as the IPC), I have heard the Additional Public
Prosecutor for the State as well as the advocate, amicus curie for the
convict on the point of quantum of sentence to be awarded to the convict
and also perused the case record.
2.      It has already been observed in the judgment that this case is a
glaring example of the growing menace of sexual abuse. Rape is an
abominable and ghastly and it worsens and becomes inhuman and
barbaric when the accused is in fiduciary relationship with the victim (as
in the present case since the accused is addressed as "Mama-maternal
uncle" of the husband of the prosecutrix), who is subjected to unwanted
physical contact by a perverted male adult.
3.             "The psychological harm on the victim is massive as it evokes
doubts, raises questions for which answers are not easy to get. The victim
may suppress emotions or be filled with feelings of rage, guilt and shame.
It is difficult for such victims to trust others later on in life. The victim
needs to stand up for himself/herself and not allow the trauma to make
them psychologically and socially weak. Active social support from
family, friends, guidance centres and counselors can bring the victim's

faith in the goodness of human beings back." ---Dr.Sanjay Chugh, Senior
Consulting Psychiatrist.
4.            The victim lacks self-confidence and is always under a sense of
guilt and denial. It's not about the body. It's more about the mind. Sexual
abuse is a rape of the mind and thought processes.
5.           The Additional Public Prosecutor for the State has requested for
the maximum sentence to be imposed upon the convict submitting that he
does not deserve any leniency keeping in view the offence committed by
him.
6.            The convict and the amicus curiae, on the other hand, have
requested for a lenient view to be taken against him and for his release on
probation as the convict hails from poor family. He is an unmarried man,
aged about 35 years. He was working as a carpenter prior to his arrest and
since then he is in custody w.e.f. 04.03.2012. He is a first offender and
has never committed any offence earlier. It is also submitted that he shall
not commit any offence in future.
7.            Considering the aforesaid submissions from both the sides, the
family circumstances of the convict and perusing the case record, I
consider it proper to award a substantive sentence upon the convict. Rape
in itself is abominable and ghastly and it worsens and becomes inhuman
and barbaric when the accused is in fiduciary relationship with the victim

(as in the present case since the accused is addressed as "Mama-maternal
uncle" of the husband of the prosecutrix), who is subjected to unwanted
physical contact by a perverted male adult.
8.      Keeping in view the offence committed by the convict, I am not
inclined to take a lenient view against him and release him on probation.
He has raped a young woman who was helpless, defenceless, vulnerable
and an easy prey. She also had a one month pregnancy at the time of
incident. The fact that the accused was not aware about her pregnancy
does not make her any less pregnant at the time of incident. He has
violated the very sanctity of the fiduciary relationship with the husband of
the prosecutrix since the accused is addressed as "Mama-maternal uncle"
of the husband of the prosecutrix. His abominable, perverted and ghastly
act worsens and becomes inhuman and barbaric as the prosecutrix, who
was pregnant at the time of incident, has been subjected to his unwanted
physical contact.
9.               I am of the considered opinion that the convict should be
awarded a substantive, stern and firm sentence because he has defiled her.
As per social morality which attaches highest importance to the chastity
of a woman, the outrage and breach of her privacy and modesty is a
heinous offence. Keeping into consideration the fact that the act of rape is
an act of a perverted man, the minimum sentence provided of seven years
or a lesser imprisonment should not be awarded to the convict.

10.            The object of sentence should be to protect the society and to
deter the criminal in achieving the avowed object to law by imposing
appropriate sentence. The Courts are expected to operate the sentencing
system so as to impose such sentence which reflects the conscience of the
society and sentencing process has to be stern where it should be. To
show mercy in the case of such a heinous crime would be a travesty of
justice and the plea for leniency is wholly misplaced. The welfare and
interest of other women in the society also needs to be protected for the
reason that if the convict is released, they may be subjected by him in a
similar offence with them.
11.         It has been held in the judgment reported as State of Karnataka
v. Raju, 2007 (11) SCC 490, as follows:
12.          Undue sympathy to impose inadequate sentence would do more

harm to the justice system to undermine the public confidence in the

threats.

       clauses of penal provisions, containing complex exceptions and
       provisions."
15.                 In the present case, the convict has committed rape on a
pregnant young woman. Due to her medical condition and the threat
extended to her by the convict, she was in a position to offer much
resistance to the convict. The convict has taken advantage of a helpless
and defenceless vulnerable prey. She must have undergone immense
physical pain and agony when the offence was committed. The convict
went on to commit the ghastly, abominable, inhuman and barbaric act of
rape, violating her person and giving her a lifelong trauma.
16.            Sexual violence apart from the being a dehumanizing act is an
unlawful intrusion on the right of privacy and sanctity of a female. It is a
serious blow to her supreme honour and offends her self-esteem and
dignity. It degrades and humiliates the victim and leaves behind a
traumatic experience. A rapist not only causes physical injuries but more
indelibly leaves a scar on the most cherished possession of a woman i.e.
her dignity, honour, reputation and not the least her chastity. Rape is not
only a crime against the person of a woman, it is a crime against the
entire society. It destroys the entire psychology of a woman and pushes
her into deep emotional crisis. It is a crime against basic human rights,
and is also violative of the victim's most cherished of the Fundamental
Rights, namely, the Right to Life contained in Article 21 of the
Constitution of India, 1950 (in short the Constitution) the Courts, are

therefore, expected to deal with cases of sexual crime against women
with utmost sensitivity. Such cases need to be dealt with sternly and
severely. A society sensitized judge is a better statutory armour in cases of
crime against women than long clauses of penal provisions, containing
complex exceptions and provisions (Reliance can be placed upon 2004
IX AD (S.C.) 5 and Shri Bodhisattwa Gautam v. Miss Subhra
Chakraborty (AIR 1996 SC 922).
17.           Recently, crime against women generally and rape in particular
is on the increase and the society also appears to be concerned for the
honour of women. In this backdrop, this Court is required to treat the
issue with more sensitivity. The object of sentence is not only required to
be reformative but it should also be punitive, preventive and deterrent.
18.              In the present case, the act of the convict is most deplorable,
both legally and morally. It is time for realization that certain category of
sexually depraved behaviour is totally unacceptable in the Indian Socio-
Legal System which seeks to protect the chastity the first virtue of a
woman and eying the wife of another can prove to be costly as has
happened in the present case. The victim is a hapless and one month
pregnant woman.
19.            Keeping in view the ghastly and inhuman act of the convict, a
substantive and stern sentence is required to be imposed upon the convict
so that it is not only in commensuration with the gravity of the crime but

also serves as an example for the others who might also venture on the
same forbidden path. The convict does not deserve any leniency.
20.     Therefore, considering these aggravating facts, I hereby sentence
Mr.Ramjee Lal, the convict as follows:
21.     All the sentences shall run concurrently, in the event of the fine not
being realized.

22.     Benefit of Section 428 Code of Criminal Procedure shall be given
to the convict for the period already undergone by him during the trial, as
per rules. The convict is in judicial custody. He is sent to judicial custody
for serving the remaining sentence.
23.     The entire amount of fine, if realized, is awarded to the prosecutrix
as compensation for the benefit of the prosecutrix.
24.     Further, this Court directs that the State shall pay to the
prosecutrix/victim a sum of Rs.3 lacs as victim compensation in terms
of Rules 3 and 5 read with Entry 2 to the schedule of the Delhi Victims
Compensation Scheme 2011 (notified on 02.02.2012) read with section
357-A of the Cr.P.C. The terms of the scheme entitle every rape victim to
minimum compensation of Rs.2 lacs and a maximum compensation of
Rs.3 lacs. Having regard to the facts of the case and the circumstances of
the prosecutrix/victim, the Government of NCT is directed to pay the said
maximum amount of Rs.3 lacs to the victim. 75 % of the amount shall be
deposited in a fixed deposit, in terms of Rule 7 of the Scheme, in a
nationalized bank for a period of three years and the remaining 25 % shall
be available for utilization and initial expenses by the victim/prosecutrix.
25.     These directions shall be complied within six weeks. The Delhi
Legal Services Authority, which is the designated body under the said
Scheme, shall oversee the implementation of these directions. The State

shall ensure that the victim is duly informed within one week. The victim
shall appear the Delhi Legal Services Authority on 05.02.2013 for the
said purpose.
26.      The convict is informed that he has a right to prefer an appeal
against this judgment. He has been apprised that in case he cannot afford
to engage an advocate, he can approach the Legal Aid Cell, functioning in

copy of the relevant case record, in compliance of directions of the High
Court, be given to the convict, namely, Mr.Ramjee Lal, free of cost im-
mediately. Another set be attached with his jail warrants.

on sentence dated 24.01.2013 also be given to the Additional Public Pros-
ecutor, as requested.

sincere and laborious efforts in this case with their very able assistance
