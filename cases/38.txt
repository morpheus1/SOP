room and locked them by putting the latches outside the
room and raised alarm. On hearing the noise, someone

material incriminating evidence. However, he admitted
that he was taken to GTB hospital and Dr.          Sudhanshu
Shekar medically examined him vide MLC No. 4598/09. He
pleaded that he went to PS himself at about 11.30 PM in
the night of 30.09.2009. He pleaded that he never went to
the house of the prosecutrix or her husband. They were in
the habit of making false cases against innocent persons
and within the duration of 3-4 months, they made out 3-4
cases. He was innocent.
8.             Accused Rakesh Kumar admitted that PW1
Lajpat Rai was residing at the second floor of the house

SC No.150/13            State vs. Rakesh & Anr.     Page 5 of 30
 No. 206/1 B, Gali no. 10, ___z_____ Nagar and his son and
daughter in law were residing on the first floor of the said

He denied the rest of the incriminating evidence. However,

hospital where his samples were taken and he was
medically examined by Dr. Sudhanshu Shekar vide MLC No.
4598/09 vide MLC Ex. PW13/A and that prosecutrix and her
husband correctly identified him. He pleaded that husband
of the prosecutrix is son of his father's sister (bua). He had
borrowed Rs. 10,000/- from him which he had given him
after borrowing from Nand Lal for a period of one month.
Nand Lal started demanding his money and consequently,
he made a telephone call to the husband of the
prosecutrix. On his persistent demand, he asked him to
come at his house to collect the money and accordingly, he
went at his house alone at about 8.00 PM or 8.30 PM on
30.09.2009. He parked his motorcycle inside the gallery of

SC No.150/13         State vs. Rakesh & Anr.        Page 6 of 30
 that house and made a telephone call to the husband of
the prosecutrix from his mobile. Thereafter, husband of the
prosecutrix arrived at his house and he asked him to call
Nand Lal. He made a telephone call to Nand Lal but he
declined to come. Thereafter, he was confined in a room.
He pleaded that he did not commit any wrong act and he
has been falsely implicated in this case.
9.             In support of their defence, both the accused
examined themselves as DW1 and DW2 under Section 315
of the Code. Besides, they examined HC Ramesh Chand as
DW3, Sh. Karun, LDC Record Room as DW4, HC Rajinder
Singh as DW5, HC Sunita as DW6 and HC Raj Kumar as
DW7.
10.            After closing of evidence by both the parties, I
have heard final arguments addressed by Ld. Additional
Public Prosecutor for the State and Ld. Defence Counsel for
both the accused and perused file and written arguments
submitted by Ld. defence Counsel.
11.            In order to prove its case that accused persons
committed an offence of gang rape, punishable u/s 376 (2)
(g) IPC, the prosecution has to prove firstly that either both
or any of accused persons in furtherance of their common

SC No.150/13            State vs. Rakesh & Anr.      Page 7 of 30
 intention      committed      sexual       intercourse   with     the
prosecutrix      and    secondly,       sexual   intercourse     was
committed against will of the prosecutrix.
12.             It has been argued on behalf of Ld. Defence
Counsel that testimony of the prosecutrix is not believable
because she was in the habit of falsely implicating
innocent persons prior and after registration of present
case she got registered many cases. After taking money
i.e. after extorting the innocent people, she settled the
matter.
13.            In support of his arguments Ld. Defence relied
on a case S.D. Soni vs. State of Gujarat, 1990 Legal Eagle
(SC) 785, wherein it was held that prosecution must stand
on its own leg. Burden of proving its case beyond any
reasonable doubt is always on the prosecution.
14.            Ld. Defence Counsel further relied on a case
Riaz Ali vs. State (Govt. of NCT) Delhi, 2012 Legal Eagle
(DHC) 429, wherein it was held by DHC that where
prosecution could not prove its case, accused is entitled for
acquittal.
15.            Ld. Defence Counsel further relied on a case

SC No.150/13           State vs. Rakesh & Anr.           Page 8 of 30
Shakti Singh vs. State, 1994 Legal Eagle (DHC) 705,
wherein it was held that merely because the accused has
not given any explanation as to why the PWs deposed
against them it could not be said that their evidence must
be accepted as trustworthy.
16.            On   perusal      of    cross        examination     of     the
prosecutrix PW2, I find that she admitted that in the year
2007 she made a complaint to CAW Cell against sister of
her husband ____y_______ and her husband that after
obtaining Rs.50,000/- from the accused she withdrew that
complaint. She explained that she received that amount in
lieu of the share of her husband in ancestral property in
Haryana. She denied the suggestion that she received the
amount of money, not regarding any property dispute but
in regard to allegation of molestation.
17.            The prosecutrix PW-2 further admitted that she
knew one Narender Kumar Jain who used to reside in front
of    her   house    at    ________z-3___________________________
before her marriage with Kamal. She lodged a complaint
against him on 15.4.2009 for his allegedly molesting her
and FIR was registered against her after four months of
that incident and that on 16.4.2009, Narender Kumar Jain
executed a pronote in her favour in settlement of that

SC No.150/13              State vs. Rakesh & Anr.                 Page 9 of 30
 complaint and also promised to pay a sum of Rs. One lakh.
She explained that that sum was borrowed by him when
she received the amount after the death of her first
husband from BPL Company. She denied the suggestion
that a sum of Rs. One lakh was paid to her in lieu of
settlement.
18.            The prosecutrix PW2 further admitted that she
got registered another FIR against Narender Kumar Jain on
24.8.2009, copy of which was placed on judicial record as
Mark D1. She explained that FIR was got registered as he
came to her house in drunken state and misbehaved with
her. She explained that it is not in her knowledge if
Narender Kumar Jain then filed a complaint against her for
extortion, etc.


19.            The prosecutrix PW2 further admitted that she
also lodged another case against the present accused at
Burari. She explained that accused asked her to sit in the
car and to talk about the present case. She denied the
suggestion that IO in that case filed closure report and also
filed a case u/s 182 IPC against her.
20.            PW1, landlord of the prosecutrix deposed that
his wife might have lodged a report against prosecutrix

SC No.150/13           State vs. Rakesh & Anr.     Page 10 of 30
 ____x_____ as her activities and activities of her husband
were not good. He admitted that he paid Rs. 20,000/- to
____x_____ to vacate his tenanted premises from her.
21.            DW1 the accused No. 1, inter alia, stated that
Lajpat Rai told him that he had given Rs.10,000/- to
____y_______ for not implicating him in a false case. He
came to know that ____y_______ and his wife got registered
4/5 false cases of the same kind against other persons to
extort money.
22.            DW3 deposed that on 29.6.2013 he was working
as Duty Officer at P.S. Paharganj. On the complaint of Ritu
dated 28.6.2013 after making his endorsement SHO
handed over to him after making his endorsement and he
had recorded FIR No. 175/13 at P.S. Paharganj u/s 376(2)(g)
IPC. He proved the computerized copy of FIR as EX.DW3/A.
On perusal of EX.DW3/A I find that FIR was registered
against accused Naresh Aggarwal with the allegation that
after giving allurement of service, he took her to hotel
where another person who appeared to be a manager met
them and both of them committed rape on her.
23.            DW4   deposed       that     he   had   brought     the
summoned record i.e. complete file in respect of FIR No.

SC No.150/13           State vs. Rakesh & Anr.            Page 11 of 30
 36/10 at P.S. Welcome. Copy of FIR was proved as
EX.DW4/A. On perusal of EX.DW4/A I find that ____y_______,
husband of the prosecutrix got registered an FIR.
24.            DW5 deposed that on 04.6.2013 he was working
as Duty Officer at P.S. Krishna Nagar and he had recorded
FIR No. 250/13 at P.S. Krishna Nagar. He proved the
computerized copy of FIR as EX.DW5/A. On perusal of
EX.DW5/A I find that prosecutrix got registered an FIR
against Rajender Gupta and Gajender Gupta, etc.


25.            DW6 deposed that on 26.9.2013 he was working
as Duty Officer at P.S. Shahbad Dairy and he had recorded
FIR No. 493/13 at P.S. Shahbad Dairy and proved the
computerized copy of FIR as EX.DW6/A. On perusal of
EX.DW6/A against Reeta Verma and Manish Agrawal Rajesh
Verma, his brother in relation of Kamal and brother in law
of Smt. ____x_____.
26.            DW7 deposed that on 24.8.2009 he was working
as Duty Officer at P.S. Bhajan Pura and he had recorded FIR
No. 333/09 at P.S. Bhajan Pura and he proved the
computerized copy of FIR as EX.DW7/A. On perusal of
EX.DW7/A, I find that Ms. Gauri Chopra i.e. complainant got
registered a case against Narender Kumar Jain.
 27.            The     evidence      on        record    and   particularly
discussed herein above has established that on the basis
of various complaints of the prosecutrix and her husband
several cases against other persons were registered. This
arguments of the Ld. defence counsel is convincing.
28.            Ld. Defence Counsel further argued that there
are     several      contradictions       in    the     testimony   of   the
prosecution witnesses and that has created reasonable
suspicion and shadow of doubt in the truthfulness of the
prosecution case.
29.            Ld. Defence Counsel further relied on a case
Narender Singh vs. State of Madhya Pradesh, 2004 Legal
Eagle (SC) 371, wherein it has been held by Apex Court
that:
30.            Ld. Defence Counsel further relied on a case
Rajoo & Ors. vs. State of M.P., 2008 Legal Eagle (SC) 1629,
wherein the Apex Court allowed the appeal and acquitted
the accused and observed that:
31.            On   the    other     hand,          Ld.   Additional   Public
Prosecutor argued that prosecution witnesses have proved
the    case     beyond      reasonable         suspicion       and     doubt.
Testimonies of prosecution witnesses are reliable and
trustworthy and accused is liable to be convicted. She also
argued that minor discrepancies, if any, may be ignored in
view of the principles of law laid down in case of State v.
Jai Hind, 2012 VI AD (Delhi) 170 wherein it was held that:
32.            On analysing the evidence on record, I find that
contradictions in the testimonies of prosecution witnesses
on the following points:
Rate of Rent


33.            PW1 who was landlord of the prosecutrix in his
cross examination stated that rate of rent of the premises
in which the prosecutrix was residing was Rs.5,000/- p.m.
excluding       electricity   and      water        charges.       PW2      the
prosecutrix in her cross examination stated that they used
to    pay      Rs.4,500/-      as     rent         for    the   house        of
___z_____excluding        electricity.       The         husband     of     the
prosecutrix stated that rate of rent was Rs.2,500/- p.m.
excluding water and electricity charges. Thus, there is

SC No.150/13             State vs. Rakesh & Anr.                   Page 15 of 30
 inconsistency on the amount of rent of the premises at
when offences were allegedly committed.
Presence of accused at the spot


34.            PW1 landlord on this aspect deposed that on
30.09.2009 at about 8.15 PM, on hearing commutation and
hearing voice of the prosecutrix ___x__, he came to ground
floor from second floor of the said house and then Gauri
told him that two persons had committed wrong act with
her and those persons were their relative like nandoi and
like such relationship. He had seen one person out of said
two accused as he was standing there and he locked him
inside the room. PW1 identified that accused in the Court
as Rakesh.
35.            PW2, inter alia, deposed that on 29.09.2009,
she                  was                    residing             at
__________________z_____________________. She was having
one daughter aged about 3 ½ years. At that time, her
husband was selling video, CDs on wheel cart in ____z-2___.
On 29.09.2009, at about 8.00 or 8.30 PM, she was alone at

 relation and accused Nand Lal, who was husband of the
sister of her husband. She offered them water and touched
their feet. Her husband was not present there. After taking
water, accused Rakesh caught hold her hand. When she
objected and tried to shout accused Rakesh closed her
mouth with his hand and put her on the bed. At that time
accused were drunken. Accused Nand Lal bolted the door
from inside. Thereafter, accused Nand Lal caught hold her
hands and Rakesh after using condom committed rape on
her. After committing rape, he threw the condom under the
bed. Thereafter Nand Ram committed rape on her while
using condom. After that act she tried to come out of the
room on the pretext of going to washroom while the
accused were dressing up and she raised cry. The accused
tried to caught hold her but she got herself released by
saying that she had to urgently attend the call of nature.
After coming out of the room, she bolted the room from
outside and raised a cry. She had come out without her
salwar and her neighbour, mother of Madhu provided the
salwar of her daughter to her. In the meantime, someone
from the neighbourhood called the PCR. Someone also
called her husband. Hearing her cries, her husband Lajpat
Rai came down stairs and she called her husband through
phone. Firstly, the PCR Van arrived which was followed by
her husband. The police officials opened the room and

SC No.150/13        State vs. Rakesh & Anr.      Page 17 of 30
 caught hold the two accused. In her cross examination she
admitted the CD Ex.PW2/DE as genuine and further that
she was seeing in the CD that she had bolted only one
accused inside while one managed to flee away.
36.            PW3 on this aspect deposed that on 30.09.2009,
he used to reside with his wife ____x_____ and her daughter

 pointing out the prosecutrix site plan Ex. PW14/B was

was lying closed when they arrived at the spot at about
3.00 AM in the night. The room was opened by him and he
found both the accused inside the room.
40.            Thus, the landlord and prosecutrix deposed that
only one accused was apprehended at the spot while in
contradiction of their testimony remaining prosecution
witnesses PW3 husband of the prosecutrix, PW10, PW12
and PW14 deposed that both accused persons were
present at the spot and both were apprehended from that
place.
Consumption of liquor by the accused


41.            PW2 the prosecutrix, inter alia, stated that at

 of the prosecutrix.       Presence of smell or influence of
alcohol has not been mentioned in the MLC Ex.PW13/A of
accused Nand Lal and MLC of accused Rakesh. The
testimonies of all material witnesses i.e. PW3 husband of
the prosecutrix, PW10, PW12 and PW14 who are police
officials are also silent on this aspect.             This is also a
contradiction


CONCLUSIONS


42.            On   considering      the     rival   contentions     of
Additional Public Prosecutor for the state, Ld. defence
Counsel for the accused persons and analyzing the
evidence on record, I come to the conclusion that
prosecution has failed to prove its case against the
accused beyond any reasonable suspicion and shadow of
doubt     that accused committed above referred alleged
offences.      The reasons which support my decision are
firstly that testimony of the prosecutrix as discussed herein
above in detail, was found inconsistent, contradictory,
unreliable and untrustworthy and it has created reasonable
suspicion and shadow of doubt in the truthfulness of the
present case.
43.            My decision finds support by principles of law


SC No.150/13           State vs. Rakesh & Anr.             Page 21 of 30
 laid down in case Narender Kumar v. State (NCT of Delhi),
2012 (5) LRC 137 (SC) wherein the Apex Court observed
that:
44.            Secondly,     it   has    been       established     by     the
accused persons as discussed in detail herein above that
the prosecutrix and her husband were in the habit of
making false allegations against innocent persons and on
the basis of those reports, they succeeded in extorting
money from the innocent persons. The landlord of the
prosecutrix also deposed against the prosecutrix in that
regard. That has also created reasonable suspicion and
shadow of doubt in the truthfulness of the testimony of
prosecutrix      and      other    prosecution        witness     i.e.,   her
husband.
45.            Thirdly,    the     accused          persons   have        also
examined themselves as defence witnesses and deposed
that they have been falsely implicated due to the reason
that accused Rakesh had lent Rs. 10,000/- to ____y_______

SC No.150/13              State vs. Rakesh & Anr.                 Page 22 of 30
 after taking the same from another accused Nand Lal and
he had gone there to collect the money and he was falsely
implicated due to that reason. Their testimonies are
convincing and it has same value as the value of the
testimony of the prosecution witnesses. This has further
created reasonable suspicion and shadow of doubt.
46.            My decision in this regard finds support from a
case, Pradeep Saini & Anr. v. State, 2010 IV AD (Delhi) 232,
wherein the Delhi High Court observed that:
47.            Fourthly, the scientific evidence, i.e. MLC of the
prosecutrix, Ex. PW5/A and FSL result Ex. PW14/C have not
supported the prosecution case. In the MLC of prosecutrix
sign of rape, i.e. presence of semen or pubic hair were not
not noticed by the Doctor. The medical and scientific

SC No.150/13            State vs. Rakesh & Anr.        Page 23 of 30
 evidence could not connect the accused persons with the
alleged crime.
48.            The principles of law laid in a case Chander Dev
Rai Vs. State (NCT of Delhi), 2008 Legal Eagle (DHC) 1431,
relied on by Ld. Defence Counsel, wherein Delhi High Court
held that absence of forensic evidence to connect the
appellant with the injury found on the abdomen of the
prosecutrix was sufficient to set aside the evidence.
49.            The principles of law laid down in case Suresh
N. Bhusare vs. State of Maharashtra, 1998 Legal Eagle (SC)
739, relied on by Ld. Defence Counsel provide benefit to
the accused persons. It was held therein that:
50.            The   principles    of    law      laid   down    in    case
Bibhishan vs. State of Maharashtra, 2007 Legal Eagle (SC)
1052, relied on by Ld. Defence Counsel provide benefit to


SC No.150/13            State vs. Rakesh & Anr.                 Page 24 of 30
 the accused persons. It was held therein that:
51.            The   principles    of    law      laid   down    in    case
Tameezuddin @ Tammu vs. State of (NCT) of Delhi, 2009
Legal Eagle (SC) 1255:2009 (4) C.C. Cases (SC) 282, relied
on by Ld. Defence Counsel provide benefit to the accused
persons. It was held therein that:
52.            The principles of law laid down in case Rai
Sandeep @ Deepa vs. State of NCT of Delhi, 2012 Legal
Eagle (SC) 367, relied on by Ld. Defence Counsel provide
benefit to the accused persons. It was held therein that:
53.            My decision in this regard also finds support


SC No.150/13           State vs. Rakesh & Anr.           Page 26 of 30
 from a case Chidda Ram v. State, VIII-1992(2) Crimes 1142,
it was held by Delhi High Court that:
54.            Fifthly, the prosecution evidence could not
achieve the standard of proving its case as laid down in a
case in case Ashok Narang v. State, 2012 II AD (Delhi) 481,
relied on by Ld. Defence Counsel, wherein Delhi High
Court, inter alia, held that testimony of a single witness in
a criminal trial is acceptable but the evidence must be free
of any blemish or suspicion, must impress the Court as
wholly truthful, and must appear to be natural and so
convincing that the Court has no hesitation in recording a
conviction solely on the basis of the testimony of a single
witness. The offence of rape is a heinous one which carries
grave implications for the accused if convicted. Therefore,
the degree of proof had to be of a high standard and not a
mere possibility of committing the said offence.
55.            Sixthly, in the facts and circumstances of the

SC No.150/13           State vs. Rakesh & Anr.         Page 27 of 30
 present case coupled with the nature of evidence which
have come on the record, I am of the view that accused is
entitled to get benefit of doubt.
56.            My decision finds support by a case Ajmer Singh
and another v. State of Haryana,                  II-1989(1) Crimes 424,
wherein it was held by P&H High Court that:
57.             Seventlhly, Ld. Defence Counsel relied on a
case    Mohd. Jamil Vs. State of NCT of Delhi, 2008 Legal
Eagle (DHC) 740,        wherein it was held that where two
views are possible preference should be given to the view
which is favourable to the accused.
58.            My attention goes to a case reported as Sharad
Birdhichand Sarda v. State of Maharashtra, AIR 1984 SC
1622, wherein it was inter alia held by Apex court that:
The principles of law laid down in above cases are
applicable on the facts of present case and therefore, it is

SC No.150/13            State vs. Rakesh & Anr.               Page 28 of 30
 held that accused persons are entitled to get benefit of
doubt as in the present case two views, one, leads to their
innocence and another leads to their involvement in the
crime are possible.
59.            Lastly, it is one of the basic principles of criminal
jurisprudence that let hundreds of criminal may go
unpunished but one innocent person should not be
punished. It would be just fair and appropriate, if accused
persons are given benefit of doubt as the prosecution has
failed   to    prove its     case against them       beyond any
reasonable suspicion or shadow of doubt.
                                ORDER
60.            Consequent upon above reasons, discussion and
evidence on record and particularly discussed here in
above, it is held that prosecution could not prove its case
beyond any reasonable suspicion and shadow of doubt
against accused Rakesh and Nand Lal that they committed
gang rape on the prosecutrix. Resultantly, both the
accused are acquitted for the offence of gang rape punishable
u/s   376 (g) IPC by giving them benefit of doubt.
61.            However, in view of provisions of Section 437 A
of the Code accused persons are directed to furnish within

SC No.150/13             State vs. Rakesh & Anr.         Page 29 of 30
 a week bail bond/surety bond in the sum of Rs.20,000/-
with one surety each of like amount for the period of six
months.
62.            After   furnishing     of    surety   bonds,     file    be
consigned to Record Room.
