         "To call woman the weaker sex is a libel; it is man's injustice to
         woman. If by strength is meant brute strength, then, indeed, is
         woman less brute than man. If by strength is meant moral power,
         then woman is immeasurably man's superior. Has she not greater
         intuition, is she not more self-sacrificing, has she not greater powers
         of endurance, has she not greater courage? Without her, man could
         not be. If nonviolence is the law of our being, the future is with
         woman. Who can make a more effective appeal to the heart than
         woman?"----Mahatma Gandhi.
1.             Rape is a dark reality in Indian society like in any other nation.
This abnormal conduct is rooted in physical force as well as familiar and other
power which the abuser uses to pressure his victim. Nor is abuse by known
and unknown persons confined to a single political ideology or to one
economic system. It transcends barriers of age, class, language, caste,
community, sex and even family. The only commonality is power which
triggers and feeds rape. Disbelief, denial and cover-up to "preserve the family
reputation" are often then placed above the interests of the victim and her
abuse. Rape is an abominable and ghastly and it worsens and becomes
inhuman and barbaric when the victim is known to the culprit, as in the
present case, who is allegedly subjected to unwanted physical contact by a
perverted male adult on the pretext of promise to marry and whose trust is
betrayed by a man in whom she reposes maximum trust so much so as to
surrender herself before him into a physical relationship and then he walks out
of her life.

accused on charges of rape. They must deal with such cases with utmost

sensitivity. The Courts should examine the broader probabilities of a case and
not get swayed by minor contradictions or insignificant discrepancies in the
statement of the witnesses, which are not of a fatal nature to throw out
allegations of rape. This is all the more important because of lately crime
against women in general and rape in particular is on the increase. It is an
irony that while we are celebrating women's rights in all spheres, we show
little or no concern for her honour. It is a sad reflection and we must
emphasize that the courts must deal with rape cases in particular with utmost
sensitivity and appreciate the evidence in totality of the background of the
entire case and not in isolation." The Supreme Court has made the above
observations in the judgment reported as State of Andhra Pradesh v.

DISCUSSION, ANALYSIS AND OBSERVATIONS
27.            The question is how to test the veracity of the prosecution story
especially when it has some variations in the evidence. Mere variance of the
prosecution story with the evidence, in all cases, should not lead to the
conclusion inevitably to reject the prosecution story. Efforts should be made
to find the truth, this is the very object for which the courts are created. To
search it out, the Courts have been removing chaff from the grain. It has to
disperse the suspicious cloud and dust out the smear as all these things clog
the very truth. So long chaff, cloud and dust remains, the criminals are
clothed with this protective layer to receive the benefit of doubt. So it is a
solemn duty of the Courts, not to merely conclude and leave the case the
moment suspicions are created. It is the onerous duty of the Court within
permissible limit to find out the truth. It means, on the other hand no innocent
man should be punished but on the other hand to see no person committing an
offence should get scot-free.                  If in spite of such effort suspicion is not
dissolved, it remains writ at large, benefit of doubt has to be created to the
accused.       For this, one has to comprehend the totality of facts and the

circumstances as spelled out through the evidence, depending on the facts of
each case by testing the credibility of the witnesses, of course after excluding
that part of the evidence which are vague and uncertain.            There is no
mathematical formula through which the truthfulness of the prosecution or a
defence case could be concretized. It would depend upon the evidence of each
case including the manner of deposition and his demeans, clarity,
corroboration of witnesses and overall, the conscience of a Judge evoked by
the evidence on record. So the Courts have to proceed further and make
genuine efforts within judicial sphere to search out the truth and not stop at the
threshold of creation of doubt to confer benefit of doubt.
28.            Under this sphere, I now proceed to test the submissions of both
the sides.
IDENTITY OF THE ACCUSED
29.            There is no dispute regarding the identity of the accused Mr.Vijit
Aggarwal who has been identified by the prosecutrix. It is also not in dispute
that they were known to each other prior to the lodging of the FIR. He is also
named in the FIR.

30.            There is no dispute that the prosecutrix was above 18 years of age
at the time of the incident. In her complaints Ex.PW1/A and Ex.PW1/B, she
has stated her age as 19 years.

VIRILITY OF THE ACCUSED
31.            The accused has been medically examined by Dr.Uday Kumar
Singh (PW12) vide MLC (Ex.PW12/B) wherein it is opined that "There is
nothing to suggest that the person is not able to perform sexual act)"
32.            This report indicates that the accused is virile and is capable of
performing sexual act and is capable of committing the act of rape.
MLC OF THE PROSECUTRIX AND FSL REPORTS
33.            The MLC of the prosecutrix (Ex.PW4/A) shows that the absence
of hymen and mentions the history of contact/ rape 15 days back and is
continuing since then.
34.            The FSL report (Ex.PW13/A) shows that human semen was
detected on the underwear and semen sample of the accused. However, the
semen was not detected on the underwear and the two slides of the
prosecutrix.
35.            It has been argued that no case of rape is established against the
accused since the semen was not detected on the underwear and the two slides
of the prosecutrix. However, this contention is not tenable as it cannot be
ignored that the prosecutrix was medically examined after 15 days of the
contact/rape and all evidence may have been washed out of the body of the
prosecutrix while easing herself.
36.            Otherwise also, medical and forensic evidence is only for the

purpose of corroboration and solely on the ground of lack of such evidence,
the accused cannot be acquitted. It is evidence of the prosecutrix which is of
utmost importance and the judgment is mainly based on her evidence.
DEFENCE OF THE ACCUSED
37.            In his statement under section 313 of the Cr.P.C., the accused has
given mainly three word answers by saying "It is wrong" to most of the
questions or feigning ignorance by saying "I do not know". He has stated that
he is innocent and has been falsely implicated in this case by the prosecutrix.
He has stated that although she was friends with the prosecutrix but he had
never proposed marriage to her. They had physical relations with her free
consent and without any assurance from his side that he shall marry her. She
was fully aware that she is having physical relations with him without any
commitment of marriage.
38.            The accused has preferred not to lead any evidence in his defence
in support of his stand. I also find that the accused has not even given a
cursory suggestion to the prosecutrix to the same effect and has put a different
story in his own statement. His version in the suggestions given to the
prosecutrix is that there were no physical relations between the (denied by
her) while in his statement under section 313 of the Cr.P.C., he has admitted
the physical relations.
39.            However, the accused has neither led any evidence in his defence
to substantiate his claim nor even put any such suggestions to the prosecutrix
to prove his defence and these facts indicate that he is putting up a false

defence. The accused has only attempted unsuccessfully to mislead the Court.
40.            The accused has also failed to show any motive or malafide
intention on the part of the prosecutrix for implicating him in a false case. The
accused failed to assign any malafide motive to PW1 that she would get him
falsely implicated in a rape case. The defence of the accused does not appear
to be probable.
41.            Therefore, I am of the considered opinion that there is no veracity
in the defence of the accused.
MENS REA / MOTIVE
42.            Regarding the motive of crime, it may be observed that in a case
based on circumstantial evidence, the existence of motive assumed
significance though the absence of motive does not necessarily discredit the
prosecution case, if the case stands otherwise established by other conclusive
circumstances and the chain of circumstantial evidence is so complete and is
consistent only with the hypothesis of the guilt of the accused and inconsistent
with the hypothesis of his innocence.
43.            The motive has to be gathered from the surrounding circumstances
and such evidence should from one of the links to the chain of circumstantial
evidence. The proof of motive would only strengthen the prosecution case and
fortify the court in its ultimate conclusion but in the absence of any
connecting evidence or link which would be sufficient in itself from the face
of it, the accused cannot be convicted. Motives of men are often subjective,

submerged and unnameable to easy proof that courts have to go without clear
evidence thereon if other clinching evidence exists. A motive is indicated to
heighten the probability that the offence was committed by the person who
was impelled by the motive but if the crime is alleged to have been committed
for a particular motive, it is relevant to inquire whether the pattern of the
crime fits in which the alleged motive.
44.            In the present case there is sufficient evidence on record to show
that the accused did have a motive to commit the offence. A witness is
normally to be considered independent unless he or she springs from sources
which are likely to be tainted and that usually means unless the witness has
cause, such as enmity against the accused, to wish to implicate him falsely.
Ordinarily a close relation would be the last to screen the real culprit and
falsely implicate an innocent person. It is true, when feelings run high and
there is personal cause for enmity, that there is a tendency to drag in an
innocent person against whom a witness has a grudge along with the guilty,
but foundation must be laid for such a criticism and the mere fact of
relationship far from being a foundation is often a sure guarantee of truth.
However, there can be no sweeping generalization. Each case must be judged
on its own facts. These observations are only made to combat what is so often
put forward in cases as a general rule of prudence. There is no such general
rule. Each case must be limited to and be governed by its own facts.
45.            In the present case, a story has been projected by the accused that
the prosecutrix had physical relations with him without any proposal of
marriage or commitment to marry. This version appears to be untrue as there

is no reason why she would do so. No girl would have physical relations with
a man without any proposal of marriage or commitment to marry or assurance
of marriage. Unless there is some kind of incentive like marriage, no girl
would enter into proximity with a man that too of such private nature. The
accused has admitted being friends with the prosecutrix and also having
physical relations with him. It is also not the case that the prosecutrix is a girl
of easy virtue or characterless or known to have promiscuous. There is no
such suggestion given to the prosecutrix and impliedly it indicates that the
prosecutrix is a self respecting girl. The fact the accused had physical relations
with the prosecutrix, by itself, indicates his mala fide intention as he must
have given some allurement of marriage to her and only then she would have
established physical relations with him.
46.            The prosecutrix has also deposed in her evidence that she had
refused to make physical relations and when the accused had proposed her to
marry him and to make physical relations with her, then the prosecutrix had
permitted the accused to have physical relations with her.
47.            All these facts in totality indicate that there was criminal intention
and mens rea on the part of the accused.
DELAY IN FIR

delay in lodging of the FIR which is fatal is now being taken into

49.            As per the complaint, Ex.PW1/A dated 25.02.2008 that the
accused had proposed marriage to her and on 17.02.2008, he took her with
him on the pretext of making her meet his family. He had physical relations
with her and on 18.02.2008, he left her at Pragati Maidan Metro Station. Then
he could not be traced. In Ex.PW1/B, she has stated that on 17.02.2008, the
accused had taken her and had taken her to Badkal Lake, Faridabad, Haryana
and had raped her i.e. had physical relations with her on promise to marry and
left her on 13.02.2008 (18.02.2008).
50.            It is claimed by the accused that as the FIR has been lodged on
25.02.2008 at 3.05 pm and the delay in lodging of the FIR has been not
explained by the prosecution.
51.            The Additional Public Prosecutor on the other hand submitted that
there is no delay in the lodging of the FIR as the criminal action was swung
into motion as soon as possible since the prosecutrix was searching for the
accused.
52.            The delay in lodging the report raises a considerable doubt
regarding the veracity of the evidence of the prosecution and points towards
the infirmity in the evidence and renders it unsafe to base any conviction.
Delay in lodging of the FIR quite often results in embellishment which is a
creature of after thought. It is therefore that the delay in lodging the FIR be
satisfactorily explained. The purpose and object of insisting upon prompt
lodging of the FIR to the police in respect of commission of an offence is to
obtain early information regarding the circumstances in which the crime was

been sufficiently explained, the prosecution case would not suffer. However,
it is necessary for the Courts to exercise due caution particularly in the cases

59.            I find on perusal of the record that indeed the criminal action was
swung into motion after about a week. The prosecutrix has deposed in her
evidence that she tried to trace the accused a lot and also tried to contact him
on phone but he did not see her. It is clear that before approaching the police,
she had made efforts to trace the accused and contact him on phone but he was
not making himself available. It was only after that, she went to PS Shakurpur
to lodge the complaint and was referred to PS Uttam Nagar. The explanation
which appears to be satisfactory has been furnished by the prosecutrix. She
may not have anticipated on 17.02.2008 or 18.02.2008 that the accused would
disappear from her life after proposing marriage to her and establishing
physical relations with her. She waited and then eventually went to the police.

Infact, he had no such intention and has only exploited the prosecutix. Only

which is fatal to the prosecution story. The delay had been satisfactorily
explained.

        another man to whom she is or believes herself to be lawfully married.
        Fifthly - With her consent, when, at the time of giving such consent, by
        reason of unsoundness of mind or intoxication or the administration by

Lake from Pragati Maidan in Indica Car. The accused booked a room at
Badhkal Lake and she remained in the said room for half an hour and he made
physical body relations with her. Firstly, the prosecutrix had refused to make
physical relations and when the accused had proposed her to marry him and to
make physical relations with her, then the prosecutrix had permitted the
accused to have physical relations with her. She had made physical relations
with the accused three-four times. On 25.02.2008, her complaint (Ex.PW1/B)

examined. She had narrated the incident as it happened in PS Shakurpur as
well as PS Uttam Nagar. She had read her statement before signing it. She has
signed on the FIR (Ex.PW1/A). She did not telephone the accused between
25.02.2008 and           06.03.2008. She had talked to him on phone between
20.02.2008 and 25.02.2008 regarding the marriage between them. She may
have told the police in her statement dated 25.02.2008 that she had met the
accused in Pragati Maidan from where they had gone to Badkal Lake where
the accused had booked a room and had physical relationship with her for
about half an hour giving her assurance that he shall marry her. She has
denied that she did not meet the accused after 17.02.2008. Between
25.02.2008 and 06.03.2008, she remained at home. She had told her parents
about the FIR after getting it lodged on 25.02.2008 itself. She had not told

parents had not lodged any such missing report. She has denied that the
accused had never promised to marry her. She has denied that the accused has
never established physical relationship with her on the false pretext of
marriage. She has denied that there was no physical relationship between
herself and the accused. She has denied that the accused has never raped her.
She has denied that the accused is innocent and has been falsely implicated in
this case at her instance in order to compel him to marriage her as he is rich
and she belong to a poor family. She has denied that she has made a false
complaint of rape on 06.03.2008 in order to pressurize the accused to marry
her. She has denied that she had also made a false complaint on 25.02.2008.
She has denied that she is deposing falsely.
68.            The counsel for the accused, after reading the evidence of the
prosecutrix in the Court, has argued that it suffers from numerous
contradictions in respect of the date and year of the alleged incident, the
improvements regarding the place of incident-Badkal Lake, no hotel record
produced etc which show that her evidence is false. It has been argued that
there are contradictions in the evidence of the prosecutrix and her statements
to the police which indicates that no offence has been committed.
69.            It may be observed here that the evidence of the prosecutrix was
recorded much later to the incident and lodging of the FIR and the possibility
of her forgetting the details regarding the dates cannot be completely ruled
out.

72.            As far as minor inconsistencies are concerned in the statement of
the prosecutrix, it may be observed minor variations in the accounts of the
witnesses are often the hallmark of the truth of their testimony. When the
discrepancies were comparatively of minor character and did not go to the
root of the prosecution story, they need not be given undue importance. Mere
congruity or consistency is not the sole test of truth in the depositions. In the
depositions of witnesses there are always normal discrepancy, however,
honest and truthful they may be. Such discrepancies are due to normal errors
of observation, normal errors of memory due to lapse of time, due to mental
disposition such as shock and horror at the time of occurrence, and the like.
Material discrepancies are those which are not normal, and not expected of a

normal person. Even otherwise, when an eye witness is examined at length it
is quite possible for him to make some discrepancies. No true witness can
possibly escape from making some discrepant details. Perhaps an untrue
witness who is well tutored can successfully made his testimony totally non-
discrepant. But Courts should bear in mind that it is only when discrepancies
in evidence of witness are so incompatible with the credibility of his version
that the Court is justified in jettisoning his evidence. But too serious a view
to be adopted on mere variations falling in the narration of incident (either as
between the evidence of two witnesses or as between two statements of the
same witness) is an unrealistic approach for judicial scrutiny.
73.            The Supreme Court had an opportunity to discuss as to why
discrepancies arise in the statements of witnesses. In the judgment reported
as Bharwada Boginbhai Hijri Bhai v. State of Gujarat, 1983 (CRI) GJX
0252 SC, the Supreme Court pointed out the following reasons as to why the
discrepancies, contradictions and improvements occur in the testimonies of
the witnesses.
                   (a)By and large a witness cannot be expected to possess a
                   photographic memory and to recall the details of an incident. It
                   is not as if a video tape is replayed on the mental screen.
                   (b)Ordinarily it so happens that a witness is overtaken by
                   events. The witness could not have anticipated the occurrence
                   which so often has an element of surprise. The mental faculties
                   therefore cannot be expected to be attuned to absorb the
                   details.
                   (c)The powers of observation differ from person to person.
                   What one may notice, another may not. An object or movement
                   might emboss its image on one person's mind, whereas it might
                   go unnoticed on the part of another.
                   (d)By and large people cannot accurately recall a conversation

74.           There is no reason shown why the prosecutrix would choose the
accused only for leveling false allegations of rape and why she would
jeopardize her future by doing so especially when there are no allegations of
her having any vested interests or mala fide motive. It may be mentioned here
that in the judgment reported as State of H.P. v. Shree Kant Shekari, (2004)

75.            As regards the incident of Badkal Lake, the prosecutrix has
mentioned about the same in her statement to the police Ex.PW1/B although
there is no mention of the same in her first statement Ex.PW1/A. Even in her
evidence the narration about the accused taking her to Badkal Lake and
establishing physical relations after proposing to marry her remains
unshatterred.
76.            The fact that in her cross examination dated 28.01.2013, she has
admitted that whenever a person visits a hotel for stay purpose an entry is
made in the register and perhaps the entry was made at Badkal lake regarding
their visit, and this part of the evidence is not controverted by the accused. He
has not even suggested that they did not go there.
77.            She has deposed that the accused had talked with her regarding
marriage about 20/22.02.2008 for the first time and she also had talked with
the accused regarding their marriage after 20/22.02.2008. The accused did not
make any proposal to her before 20/22.02.2008. It is argued on behalf of the
accused this is in contradiction to her statements to the police as well as her
examination in chief where the date of 17.02.2008/18.02.2008 is mentioned. It
may be observed here that the exact date is not required from the prosecutrix
every time, especially when she has stated it in her examination in chief. It is
the act which is relevant and not the date of the act.
78.            Similarly, the contradictions of January and February, 2008 are
also too minor to be taken into considered and can be ignored as she has
categorically deposed that her consent was forced as he had told her that he

would marry her but he did not marry her. She dis not remember the dates but
it was in the months of January-February in the year 2008, when the accused
had physical relationship with her and raped her but it was 2-3 times.
79.            It is also clear that it was only after making the complaint on
25.02.2008 that she had told her parents about the incident as she has deposed
that she had told her parents about the FIR after getting it lodged on
25.02.2008 itself. She had not told them about the contents of FIR. She had
told her parents on 25.02.2008 that she was friendly with the accused and he
had assured marriage to her and established physical relationship but he had
refused to marry her regarding which she had lodged the FIR. She and her
parents had discussed about the FIR between 25.02.2008 and 06.03.2008.
80.            It may be observed here that it is settled principle of law that it is
not in every case that the version of the prosecutrix must be corroborated in
material particulars by independent witnesses. In a case where the Court is
satisfied that the testimony of the prosecutrix is free from blemish and is
implicitly reliable, then on the sole testimony of the prosecutrix conviction
can also be recorded but in appropriate cases the Court may look for
corroboration from independent sources or circumstances. The testimony of
the prosecutrix has to be tested on the touch stone of truthfulness and
credibility.

relationship to remember all the dates and details especially when she is aware
about his presence in the Court. She has to deal with the discomfort and face
the battery of questions due to which there is a possibility that she may get
mixed up or confused about the dates and details.
CONSENT OF THE PROSECUTRIX-PROMISE TO MARRY
85.            It has been argued on behalf of the accused that the prosecutrix
was a consenting party. She willing entered into physical relationship with the
accused without any promise to marry from his side.
86.            It may be observed here that consent is an act of reason coupled
with deliberation, after the mind has weighed the good and evil on each side
in a balanced manner. Consent denotes an active will in the mind of a person
to permit the doing of an act complained off. Consent on the part of a woman,
as a defence to an allegation of rape, requires voluntary participation, not only
after the exercise of intelligence, based on the knowledge of the significance
and the moral quality of the act, but after having freely exercised a choice
between resistance and assent.
87.            An argument has been raised by the Additional Public Prosecutor
that the accused on the pretext of love and promise to marry established a
physical relationship with the prosecutrix which amounts to rape as this is
obtaining the consent of the prosecutrix by fraud and incitement which neither
voluntary nor free. Had the prosecutrix known that the accused would not
marry her, she would not established physical relations with him.

that the prosecutrix had physical relationship with the accused with her free
consent and will.
89.            The crucial expression in section 375 of the IPC which defines
rape as against her will. It seems to connote that the offending act was despite
resistance and opposition of the woman. IPC does not define consent in
positive terms. But what cannot be regarded as consent is explained in Section
90 which reads as follows:
              "Consent given firstly under fear of injury and secondly under a
              misconception of fact is not consent at all."

Jayanti Rani Panda v. State of West Bengal and anr., 2002 SCC (Cri)
1448, it has been observed that:
93.            In the present case, it is clear that that the consent of the
prosecutrix on the promise to marry can be said to be under a misconception
of fact as she was allured into having physical relations with the accused.
94.            It is clear from the evidence of the prosecutrix, her complaint
(Ex.PW1/A) as well as her statement (Ex.PW1/B) that she has stated all
through out that the accused developed physical relations with her on the
promise to marry her. Had he not so promised, she would not have allowed
him to have physical relations with her. The physical relations had been
developed between the accused and prosecutrix and later the accused Mr.Vijit

Aggarwal had refused to marry her. In the year 2008, when the accused had
made physical relations with her and thereafter the prosecutrix had been called
by accused Mr.Vijit Aggarwal at Pragati Maidan and then the accused took
her at 10:00 a.m. to Badhkal Lake from Pragati Maidan in Indica Car. The
accused booked a room at Badhkal Lake and she remained in the said room
for half an hour and he made physical body relations with her. Firstly, the
prosecutrix had refused to make physical relations and when the accused had
proposed her to marry him and to make physical relations with her, then the
prosecutrix had permitted the accused to have physical relations with her. She
had made physical relations with the accused three-four times.
95.            After establishing physical relations with her, he became
untraceable on which she was left with no other course but to make a
complaint against him to the police.
96.            Prosecutrix reacted immediately upon realizing that the accused
has broken his promise to marry her and had been establishing sexual
relations with her on the basis of false promise, implying thereby that her
consent for the sexual act was obtained under a misconception of fact, thus
constituting rape within the meaning of Section 375 IPC.
97.            The veracity of the testimony of the prosecutrix remained un-
shattered and un-impeached despite lengthy cross examination. She deposed
that the accused continued to establish sexual relations with her on the pretext
of marriage.

98.            The Hon'ble Supreme Court in numerous judicial pronouncements
has also laid down that the deposition of the prosecutrix in a rape case is vital
and can be relied upon without looking for any corroboration if the testimony
of prosecutrix is otherwise credible and inspires confidence.
99.            In the case reported as State of Punjab vs. Gurmit Singh &
Ors., AIR 1996 SC 1393(1), the Hon'ble Apex Court observed that

               "Just as a witness who has sustained some injury in the
               occurrence, which is not found to be self inflicted, is considered to
               be a good witness in the sense that he is least likely to shield the
               real culprit, the evidence of a victim of a sexual offence is entitled
               to      great       weight,      absence       of      corroboration
               notwithstanding.......The courts shoulder a great responsibility
               while trying an accused on charges on rape. They must deal with
               such cases with utmost sensitivity. The courts should examine the
               broader probabilities of a case and not get swayed by minor
               contradictions or insignificant discrepancies in the statement of
               the prosecutrix, which are not of a fatal nature, to throw out an
               otherwise reliable prosecution case. The testimony of the
               prosecutrix must be appreciated in the background of the entire
               case and the trial court must be alive to its responsibility and be
               sensitive while dealing with cases involving sexual molestations."
100.           The accused and his counsel have relied upon following judgments
in support of the arguments that the offence of rape is not made out in the
facts and circumstances of the present case:

102.           In its landmark judgment in Uday vs. State of Karnataka, AIR
2003 SC 1639, the Hon'ble Supreme Court observed as under:
103.           In the above referred case the Hon'ble Supreme Court also held
that the consent given by the prosecutrix for sexual intercourse with a person
with whom she is deeply in love, who had promised that he would marry her
at later date cannot be said to be given under a misconception of fact.
104.           This view of Hon'ble Apex Court was again followed by Hon'ble
Supreme Court in the case of Deelip Singh @ Dilip Kumar, AIR 2005 SC
2003, where it was held that where prosecutrix was raped with her consent
even before promise to marry was given, consent by victim girl cannot be said
to be given on misconception under Section 90 IPC.
105.           In the case of Manish Kumar Jayant vs. State & Anr., 2005(3)

and Deelip Singh vs. State of Bihar and observed that the offence of rape is
not made out on the allegations that physical relations developed between the
prosecutrix and the accused out of a love affair and it is only subsequent to the
such relations that the accused had promised to marry her which remained
unfulfilled.
106.           However, in the case of Deelip Singh @ Dilip Kumar, AIR 2005
SC 2003, the Hon'ble High Court further observed that
              "In other words, if the promise to marry the prosecutrix was only
              to seduce the prosecutrix to the sexual act, sexual intercourse on
              consent so derived would be an offence of rape."
107.           Keeping in view the aforesaid observations of the Hon'ble
Superior Courts, it is apparent that where the sexual relations between the
victim and the accused arise out of a love affair and subsequently accused
fails to fulfill his promise to marry the victim, the offence of rape cannot be
said to be made out in such circumstances. However, the present case, in my
opinion, stands on a totally different footing.
108.           A view which is likely to result in vicitimization or exploitation of
innocent girls needs to be avoided and the Courts need to take a view which
would discourage unscrupulous from taking advantage of innocent girls by
alluring them and having physical relations with them on a false promise of
marriage. If a view otherwise is taken, it will amount to putting premium on
the mis-conduct of a men which is not only highly reprehensible and
abhorable but also criminal in nature. If this allowed to happened it will
enable immoral and dishonest persons to exploit girls by alluring them with a

false promise of marriage, pressurizing them to have physical relations with

nothing wrong in having relations with a person who is very soon going to be
her husband and later on turn their back at her in a comfortable belief that the
law being on their side, they can easily get away with their misdeeds. The
Court can not and should not give such a licence to those who keep on looking
for opportunities to exploit the sentiments and vulnerability of Indian girls
who perceive marriage as a pious bonding and not as a union of two bodies.
Allowing such persons to go scott free after exploiting poor and helpless girls
in this manner could not have been the intention of the legislature which
considered rape to be such heinous as to attract imprisonment upto life.

111.             In Pradeep Kumar @ Pradeep Kumar Verma versus State of
Bihar & anr., Manu/SC/3266/2007, the Hon'ble Supreme Court observed
that a promise to marry without anything more will not give rise to
misconception of fact within the meaning of Section 90, I.P.C., it needs to be
clarified that a representation deliberately made by the accused with a view to
elicit the assent of the victim without having the intention or inclination to
marry her, will vitiate the consent. If on the facts it is established that at the
very inception of the making of promise, the accused did not really entertain
the intention of marrying her and the promise to marry held out by him was a
mere hoax, the consent ostensibly given by the victim will be of no avail to
the accused to exculpate him from the ambit of Section 375 of the IPC clause
second.
112.                The Hon'ble Apex Court in the judgment reported as Yedla
Srinivasa Rao versus State of A.P (2006) 11 Supreme Court Cases 615
observed that value of consent when obtained under misconception by playing
fraud by the accused by making a false promise to marry which he never
intended to fulfill then such fraudulent consent cannot be said to be a consent
so as to condoned the offence of the accused and such consent was of no
consequence. The act falls in the second category as numerated section 375 of
the IPC (sexual intercourse without consent of victim). The conviction and
sentencing of the accused under section 376 IPC were held to be justified.

false promise of marriage by the accused. She deposed before the Court that
the accused who became friends with her. He told her that he would marry her
and had physical relations with her. On the assurance that he would marry her,
he raped her.
114.           All these facts indicate that since the beginning of relationship
with the prosecutrix, he did not have any intention to marry her although he
promised to marry her and has only exploited her by having physical relations
with her. Had she known that he would not marry her, she would not have had
any physical relationship with him. Her so called consent for physical
relations is based on misconception and is neither free nor voluntary and
therefore, the same amounts to rape, as defined under section 375 of the IPC.
115.           It has also been argued that all the details especially about the
accused taking the prosecutrix to Badkal Lake are not mentioned in the
complaints (Ex.PW1/A and Ex.PW1/B) and this makes the prosecution
version unbelievable. However, I am of the considered opinion that the FIR,
the initial complaint are not required to contain all the details as it is the gist
of the offence which needs to be told to the police and all the details can be
deposed in the Court in the evidence.
116.           It also cannot be said that the same are improvements are the same
only are clarifications and explanations. In my considered opinion, not much
relevance can be attached to the fact that all the details are not mentioned in
the first complaint, in view of the fact that the prosecutrix was never
confronted with the questions in her entire cross examination on behalf of the

accused. The fact that the prosecutrix was neither cross examined on this
aspect nor confronted with her complaint in this respect would imply that the
details are not disputed.
117.           Moreover, it is well settled law that the FIR need not be an
encyclopedia of facts of any case. Reliance can be placed upon the judgment
of Hon'ble High Court of Delhi reported as Rajinder @ Lala & etc. vs.
State reported as 2010 Crl.L.J. 15, wherein it has been categorically held
that
               "It is no longer res integra that it is not the requirement of law
               that every minute detail of the occurrence needs to be recorded in
               the FIR. The FIR is not intended to be an encyclopedia of the
               background scenario of the crime.........The legal principle which
               can be culled out is that the omission of material facts pertaining
               to the crime in the FIR is a relevant factor in judging the veracity
               of the evidence of the maker of the FIR but by itself is not sufficient
               to throw the evidence of the said witness. If the evidence of said
               witness is otherwise found to be credible, the omission in the FIR
               is of no consequence."
118.           Considering the above facts and circumstances of the present case,
the judgments relied upon by accused have no application to the present case,
they being totally distinguishable on facts.
119.           In the present case, it is not the plea of the accused that the
prosecutrix consented to establish sexual relations with the accused as she was
in love with him. Not even a single suggestion to this effect was given to the
prosecutrix during her entire cross examination. Rather, from the deposition
of the prosecutrix, it has been established on record that the accused

established sexual relations with the prosecutrix after keeping her under a
false promise that he would marry her. She continued to have sexual relations
with the accused believing his promise to be true though the accused
apparently made promise to marry the prosecutrix only to seduce her into the
physical relationship and in fact never intended to marry her. In such
circumstances, it is certainly not a case where the consent of the prosecutrix
can be said to be free or voluntary and not based on misconception.
120.           It is chrystal clear from the unshaterred evidence of the prosecutrix
that the accused told her that he would marry her. Thereafter, the accused had
sexual intercourse with the prosecutrix without her consent forcibly. The
accused maintained sexual relations with the prosecutrix 2/3 times.
121.           From the above discussion, it is clear that the evidence of the
prosecution is fully reliable, believable and trustworthy regarding the veracity
of the prosecution case and the prosecution has successfully established the
commission of the offence of rape.
122.           Consequently, in the light of the above discussion, I am of the
opinion that the offence of rape punishable under Section 376 IPC clearly
proved to have been committed by the accused considering the overall facts
and circumstances of the present case. Accordingly, the accused is hereby
convicted for the offence punishable under Section 376 IPC.

by PWs 2, 3, 6 (SI Sanwar Mal), 8, 9 (SI Renuka) and 10 (SI Vijay Pal
Singh). The FIR has been proved by PW5. The MLCs of the prosecutrix and
the accused have been proved by PW4 and PW12 respectively. The FSL
report has been proved by PW13. There is nothing on the record which could
show that the investigation has not been conducted properly, fairly and
impartially.
124.            The investigation conducted including the documents prepared in
the present case has been substantially proved by the police witnesses
including the first and the second IOs. They have clearly deposed that they
were informed about the rape of the prosecutrix; the accused as well as the
prosecutrix were taken to the hospital for their medical examination; accused
was arrested; documents pertaining to his arrest were prepared; parcels of the
accused and the prosecutrix were seized; medical documents were prepared;
parcels were collected from the doctor and sent to the FSL for examination;
etc. There is nothing on the record to show that their testimonies are false or
not reliable.
125.               It is the actual crime which is important than the investigation.
Where the actual crime is being elaborated and proved in the evidence of
PW1, then the investigation becomes less important as PW1 has not only
deposed regarding the manner of commission of the crime but has also
elaborated all the details and has assigned a clear and specific role to the
accused.
126.           There are two stages in the criminal prosecution.            The first

obviously is the commission of the crime and the second is the investigation
conducted regarding the same. In case the investigation is faulty or it has not
been proved in evidence at trial, does it absolve the liability of the culprit who
has committed the offence? The answer is logically in the negative as any
lapse on the part of the investigation does not negate the offence.
127.             It may also be observed here that the accused has also failed to
show that he is not the person who had raped the prosecutrix under the
promise to marry and made her go through a farce of marriage ceremony
which is not lawful and valid. He has also failed to lead any evidence to
substantiate his claim or falsify the prosecution version or show that the
evidence of the prosecution witnesses is not reliable and credible.
CONCLUSION
128.           It s clear from the record that the evidence of the prosecutrix is
free from blemishes. It is worthy of credence and trust. Nothing has been
shown by the accused to indicate that the prosecutrix had any vested interest
in leveling false allegations against him. It is also clear from the record that
the accused proposed to marry the prosecutrix and on a promise to marry, he
established physical relations with her and then walked out of her life. Firstly,
the prosecutrix had refused to make physical relations and when the accused
had proposed her to marry him and to make physical relations with her, then
the prosecutrix had permitted the accused to have physical relations with her.

130.           In the case of Sharad Birdhichand Sarda v. State of
Maharastra, AIR 1984 SC 1622, the Apex Court has laid down the tests
which are prerequisites before conviction should be recorded, which are as
under:
131.           Applying the above principles of law to the facts of present case, it
is evident that the evidence of the prosecution especially the prosecutrix is
reliable, believable and trustworthy and the prosecution has established the
case of wrongful confinement, rape, threat and simple hurt. The facts of the
case are consistent with the hypothesis of guilt of the accused.
132.           The prosecution has successfully proved that between 25.01.2008
to 18.02.2008 from time to time at various places in and around Delhi, he had
committed rape on the prosecutrix (name withheld to protect her identity) by
promising to marry her and establishing physical relations.

133.           The prosecution has proved the identity of the accused, the manner
in which the offence has been committed, place of commission of the offence,
the investigation including the documents prepared, MLC, etc. There is
nothing which could shatter the veracity of the prosecution witnesses or
falsify the claim of the prosecution. All the prosecution witnesses have
materially supported the prosecution case and the testimonies of the
prosecution witnesses do not suffer from any infirmity, inconsistency or
contradiction and are consistent and corroborative. The evidence of the
prosecution witnesses is natural and trustworthy and corroborated by
circumstantial evidence and the witnesses of the prosecution have been able to
build up a continuous link. All the facts relevant in respect of the offence
punishable under section 376 of the IPC have been properly proved.
134.           In view of the foregoing reasons, the conscience of this Court is
completely satisfied that the prosecution has been able to successfully
bring home the charge against the accused Mr.Vijit Aggarwal regarding
the commission of offence punishable under section 376 of the IPC.
135.                  Accordingly, the accused, Mr.Vijit Aggarwal, is hereby
convicted for having committed offence punishable under section 376 of
the IPC.
136.           Let him be heard of the point of sentence.

ORDER ON SENTENCE


1.             In pursuance of judgment dated 04.03.2013 as passed by this Court
convicting the accused namely Mr.Vijit Aggarwal for offence punishable
under section 376 of the Indian Penal Code (hereinafter referred to as the
IPC), I have heard the Additional Public Prosecutor for the State as well as the
counsel for the convict on the point of quantum of sentence to be awarded to
the convict and also perused the case record.
2.             It has already been observed in the judgment that this case is a
glaring example of the growing menace of sexual abuse. Rape is an
abominable and ghastly and it worsens and becomes inhuman and barbaric
when the victim is subjected to unwanted physical contact by a perverted
male adult who on the assurance and promise to marry had physical
relationship with her and then walked out of her life.
3.               "The psychological harm on the victim is massive as it evokes
doubts, raises questions for which answers are not easy to get. The victim may
suppress emotions or be filled with feelings of rage, guilt and shame. It is
difficult for such victims to trust others later on in life. The victim needs to
stand up for himself/herself and not allow the trauma to make them
psychologically and socially weak. Active social support from family, friends,
guidance centres and counselors can bring the victim's faith in the goodness
of human beings back." ---Dr.Sanjay Chugh, Senior Consulting
Psychiatrist.

4.              The victim lacks self-confidence and is always under a sense of
guilt and denial. It's not about the body. It's more about the mind. Sexual
abuse is a rape of the mind and thought processes.
5.           The Additional Public Prosecutor for the State has requested for the
maximum sentence to be imposed upon the convict submitting that he does
not deserve any leniency keeping in view the offence committed by him.
6.          The convict and his counsel, on the other hand, have requested for a
lenient view to be taken against him and for his release on probation as the
convict hails from a modest family. He is aged 33 years and is married with
two minor children. His aged father is also dependent upon him. Both the
minor children of the convict are not keeping well and the elder one needs to
undergo a heart surgery. He is doing a private job. He was in custody w.e.f.
06.03.2008 to 27.03.2008. He is a first offender and has never committed any
offence earlier. It is also submitted that he shall not commit any offence in
future.
7.               Considering the aforesaid submissions from both the sides, the
family circumstances of the convict and perusing the case record, I consider it
proper to award a substantive sentence upon the convict. Rape in itself is
abominable and ghastly and it worsens and becomes inhuman and barbaric
when the convict under the guise of promise to marry the prosecutrix has
violated her person and soul by having physical relationship and then refused
to marry her. He has subjected the prosecutrix to unwanted physical contact
by a perverted male adult as had she known that he would not marry her, she

would not have surrendered herself to him into a physical relationship. Her
consent was obtained by fraud and on mis-conception of facts.
8.             Keeping in view the offence committed by the convict, I am not
inclined to take a lenient view against him and release him on probation. He
has raped a young woman who was helpless, defenceless, vulnerable and an
easy prey. He has violated the very sanctity of the relationship between them.
9.          I am of the considered opinion that the convict should be awarded a
substantive, stern and firm sentence because he has defiled her. As per social
morality which attaches highest importance to the chastity of a woman, the
outrage and breach of her privacy and modesty is a heinous offence. Keeping
into consideration the fact that the act of rape is an act of a perverted man, the
minimum sentence provided of seven years or a lesser imprisonment should
not be awarded to the convict. I do not find any mitigating factors.
10.           The object of sentence should be to protect the society and to deter
the criminal in achieving the avowed object to law by imposing appropriate
sentence. The Courts are expected to operate the sentencing system so as to
impose such sentence which reflects the conscience of the society and
sentencing process has to be stern where it should be. To show mercy in the
case of such a heinous crime would be a travesty of justice and the plea for
leniency is wholly misplaced. The welfare and interest of other women in the
society also needs to be protected for the reason that if the convict is released,
they may be subjected by him in a similar offence with them.

harm to the justice system to undermine the public confidence in the efficacy

15.            In the present case, the convict has committed rape on a pregnant
young woman. Due to her medical condition and the threat extended to her by
the convict, she was in a position to offer much resistance to the convict. The
convict has taken advantage of a helpless and defenceless vulnerable prey.
She must have undergone immense physical pain and agony when the offence
was committed. The convict went on to commit the ghastly, abominable,
inhuman and barbaric act of rape, violating her person and giving her a
lifelong trauma.

innocent girls needs to be avoided and the Courts need to take a view which
would discourage unscrupulous from taking advantage of innocent girls by
alluring them and having physical relations with them on a false promise of
marriage. If a view otherwise is taken, it will amount to putting premium on
the mis-conduct of a men which is not only highly reprehensible and
abhorable but also criminal in nature. If this allowed to happened it will
enable immoral and dishonest persons to exploit girls by alluring them with a
false promise of marriage, pressurizing them to have physical relations with
them by making them believe that they are going to marry them and there is
nothing wrong in having relations with a person who is very soon going to be
her husband and later on turn their back at her in a comfortable belief that the
law being on their side, they can easily get away with their misdeeds. The
Court can not and should not give such a licence to those who keep on looking
for opportunities to exploit the sentiments and vulnerability of Indian girls
who perceive marriage as a pious bonding and not as a union of two bodies.
Allowing such persons to go scott free after exploiting poor and helpless girls
in this manner could not have been the intention of the legislature which
considered rape to be such heinous as to attract imprisonment upto life.

17.              Sexual violence apart from the being a dehumanizing act is an
unlawful intrusion on the right of privacy and sanctity of a female. It is a
serious blow to her supreme honour and offends her self-esteem and dignity.
It degrades and humiliates the victim and leaves behind a traumatic

experience. A rapist not only causes physical injuries but more indelibly
leaves a scar on the most cherished possession of a woman i.e. her dignity,
honour, reputation and not the least her chastity. Rape is not only a crime
against the person of a woman, it is a crime against the entire society. It
destroys the entire psychology of a woman and pushes her into deep
emotional crisis. It is a crime against basic human rights, and is also violative
of the victim's most cherished of the Fundamental Rights, namely, the Right
to Life contained in Article 21 of the Constitution of India, 1950 (in short the
Constitution) the Courts, are therefore, expected to deal with cases of sexual
crime against women with utmost sensitivity. Such cases need to be dealt with
sternly and severely. A society sensitized judge is a better statutory armour in
cases of crime against women than long clauses of penal provisions,
containing complex exceptions and provisions (Reliance can be placed upon
2004 IX AD (S.C.) 5 and Shri Bodhisattwa Gautam v. Miss Subhra
Chakraborty (AIR 1996 SC 922).
18.            Recently, crime against women generally and rape in particular is
on the increase and the society also appears to be concerned for the honour of
women. In this backdrop, this Court is required to treat the issue with more
sensitivity. The object of sentence is not only required to be reformative but it
should also be punitive, preventive and deterrent. The offences against women
are on a rise and there is an urgent need to curb this tendency by awarding
deterrent punishment to perpetrators of this grave offence.
19.            In the present case, the act of the convict is most deplorable, both
legally and morally. It is time for realization that certain category of sexually

depraved behaviour is totally unacceptable in the Indian Socio-Legal System
which seeks to protect the chastity the first virtue of a woman and such
behaviour can prove to be costly as has happened in the present case. The
victim is a young woman who reposed trust in the convict and on his promise
to marry him surrendered before him into a physical relationship. Then the
convict shattered her faith and trust in him and refused to marry her.
20.              Keeping in view the ghastly and inhuman act of the convict, a
substantive and stern sentence is required to be imposed upon the convict so
that it is not only in commensuration with the gravity of the crime but also
serves as an example for the others who might also venture on the same
forbidden path. The convict does not deserve any leniency.

hereby sentence Mr.Vijit Aggarwal, the convict for offence under section
376 of the IPC to rigorous imprisonment for seven years and a fine in the
sum of Rs.50,000/- in default of payment of which, he shall undergo
rigorous imprisonment for a period of one year.
