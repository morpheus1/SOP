(witness) itna pyar karta hai uspe aisa ilzaam nahi lagana. Tara Chand

meri mammi ko wiswas nahi hua ki wo aisa galat kaam karta hoga aur  

issi karan mai kisi ko nahi bata pai].  The witness has also deposed that

 that she used to go tuition alone.  She has denied the suggestion that she 

had   made   physical   relations   with   some   other   person   and   when   her 

parents came to know about the same, in order to save their honour, they 

have falsely implicated Tara Chand.  She has also denied the suggestion 

that she has deposed falsely to implicate the accused at the instance of 

her parents.

that   the   source   of   exhibit   1a,   1b,   2a   &   2b   were   subjected   to   DNA 

isolation and DNA was isolated from the source of exhibit  1a, 1b, 2a & 

2b and DNA profile was generated for the exhibits 1a, 1b, 2a & 2b by 

suing  AmpFL STR Identifier Plus PCR Amplification kit.   He has 

also deposed that STR analysis was used for each of the sample and Data 

was analysed by using Gene Mapper ID­X software.  According to him, 

on examination one set of alleles of the source of exhibit 1a (Blood of 

accused), 1b (blood in gauze of accused) are accounted in the alleles 

of the source of exhibit 2a (POC of victim) and exhibit 2b (pads in 

normal saline of victim).   The witness has proved having concluded 

that  the  DNA  Profiling   (STR  Analysis)  performed  on  the exhibits 

provided is sufficient to conclude on set of alleles from the source of 

exhibit   2a   (small   quantity of  dark  liquid  i.e. POC of  victim)  and 

exhibit 2b (pads in normal saline of victim) are similar with one set 

of   alleles   of   the   source   of   exhibit   1a   (blood   of   accused)   and   1   b 

(blood in gauze of accused).   He has proved his detail report in this

St. Vs. Tara Chand, FIR No. 150/12, PS S.P. Badli                                  Page No. 21
 incident   photographed   through   a  private   photographer   Nitin  and   also

reached   the   hospital   within   five   to   ten   minutes   and   at   the   time   she 

reached the hospital only the parents of the child were present with her. 

She has admitted that she recorded the statement of the prosecutrix after 

the representative of the NGO had counselled her and that the child had 

first disclosed the incident to the doctors.  The witness has also admitted 

that in the first information which was received by them  the name of the 

accused was not mentioned.   She has denied the suggestion that when

accused to her or that the prosecutrix had mentioned the name of the 

accused in her statement on the basis of which the FIR was registered on

 any exhibit to her regarding the alleged aborted fetus.  She has testified 

that   she   had   asked   the   doctors   regarding   the   exhibits   of   the   alleged 

aborted   fetus   but   they   informed   them   that   they   did   not   preserve   the 

same.  The witness has admitted that the prosecutrix was a minor and on 

the face of it appeared to be below 16 years of age and it was necessary 

for the doctors to has immediately informed the police about the incident 

and preserved  the  evacuated material/ aborted fetus as case property. 

According to her, she did not initiate against the erring doctors in this 

regard but she cannot confirm if any action was taken by her successor. 

She has denied the suggestion that the said material was deliberately not 

collected or preserved at the instance of the prosecutrix as it would has 

proved the innocence of the accused or that that she did not carry out the 

free and fair investigations or that the investigations were motivated at 

the instance of the parents of the prosecutrix.
(28)              PW12 Inspector Parvati Devi has deposed that on 29.5.2012 

while she was posted as Inspector at Police Station South Rohini, she 

was handed over the investigations of the present case.  According to her, 

on 29.6.2012 during her investigations she got the ossification test/ age 

determination test of the prosecutrix conducted from BSA Hospital and 

she obtained the ossification test report which is Ex.PW11/A according 

to which the estimated age of the prosecutrix 'P'   was  more than 14 

years   and   less   than   16   years.   Witness   has   further   deposed   that   on 

14.7.2012 she got the spot of incident videographed through the private 

St. Vs. Tara Chand, FIR No. 150/12, PS S.P. Badli                                Page No. 23
 photographer   Nitin   who   thereafter   handed   over   the   CD   of   the   video 

recording to her and   he recorded the statement of Nitin.       She has 

testified that after discussing with the senior officers, the provisions of 

Section   506   IPC   were   added.     She   has   proved   having   recorded   the 

statements of the witnesses and after completion of investigations, the 

charge   sheet   was   filed   in   the   Court   through   SHO   Police   Station 

Samaypur Badli.   The witness has not been cross examined by the Ld. 

defence counsel despite opportunity in this regard and his testimony has 

gone uncontroverted. 
(29)              The   accused   Tara   Chand   has   admitted   his   MLC   which   is 

Ex.PX5.  On 5.12.2012 the Ld. Addl. Public Prosecutor for the State has 

requested for sending the exhibits for re­examination pursuant to which 

the SHO concerned was directed to ensure that the exhibits were sent to 

the FSL and the fresh DNA examination was got conducted.  



STATEMENT OF ACCUSED/ DEFENCE EVIDENCE:
(30)              After completion of prosecution evidence the statement of the 

accused Tara Chand was recorded under Section 313 Cr.P.C. wherein all 

incriminating evidence was put to him which he has denied.   He has 

denied having made any disclosure statement and has stated that he has 

been arrested on false allegations.  According to him, the date of birth 

given in the school record is incorrect.  He has further stated that he is 

innocent and has been falsely implicated.

St. Vs. Tara Chand, FIR No. 150/12, PS S.P. Badli                               Page No. 24
 (31)             Today, an additional statement of the accused was recorded 

wherein the DNA Fingerprinting Report was put to the accused to which 

he stated that the said report is incorrect.


FINDINGS:
(32)              I have heard the arguments advanced before me by the Ld. 

Addl. PP for the State and the Ld. Defence Counsel.  I have also gone 

through   the   material   on   record   and   the   written   memorandum   of 

arguments filed on behalf of the accused.  My findings are as under: 

  

Identity of the accused: 
(33)              In   so   far   as   the   identity   of   the   accused   Tara   Chand   is 

concerned, the same is not disputed.  He has been specifically named in 

the FIR.   He is closely related to the family of the victim being her 

Mausa (husband of mother's sister) and has also been correctly identified 

by the prosecutrix/ victim in the Court.  In view of the above, I hold that 

the identity of the accused Tara Chand stands established.



Age of the prosecutrix: 
(34)              The case of the prosecution is that the victim 'P' is aged about 

13 years and in her testimony before this Court as well she has given her 

age as 13 years.  According to the school record the date of birth of the 

prosecutrix   is   2.4.2002.     However,   the   said   date   of   birth   of   the 


St. Vs. Tara Chand, FIR No. 150/12, PS S.P. Badli                                    Page No. 25
 prosecutrix was recorded only on the basis of the affidavit filed by her 

father Joginder.  Therefore, there being no authentic document showing 

the date of birth of the prosecutrix, her ossification/ age determination 

test was got conducted.  As per the ossification/ age determination test 

report which is Ex.PW11/A the estimated age of the prosecutrix 'P' was 

opined   to   be  more   than   14   years   but   less   than   16   years   as   on 

29.6.2012  thereby   showing   that   at   the   time   of   the   incident   she   was 

between 14­16 years of age.  In view of the above, I hereby hold that at 

the time of the incident the prosecutrix 'P' was between 14­16  years of 

age not even having attained the age of consent and her consent, if any, 

becomes immaterial.


Medical evidence:  
(35)              PW4 Dr. Hemlata has proved the MLC of the victim 'P' which 

is  Ex.PW4/A  showing that the victim had been brought to hospital by 

her father Joginder at 1:34 AM on 2.5.2012 as she was complaining of 

pain in abdomen and bleeding per vagina from 5 days and history of 

passage of some fleshy mass per vagina at home.  She has proved that 

Dr.   Rohini   Aggarwal   medically   examined   the   prosecutrix   'P'   in   the 

Labour Room and UPT was found positive but the parents did not give 

any   history   pertaining   to   the   sexual   or   physical   assault.     On   further 

examination   of   the   prosecutrix   'P'   she   observed   slight   bleeding   per 

vagina, hymen was torn, cervical OS was closed and uterus was found 

St. Vs. Tara Chand, FIR No. 150/12, PS S.P. Badli                                Page No. 26
 ante­verted & normal size.  According to Dr. Hemlata it is on account of 

the aforesaid reasons that the prosecutrix 'P' was admitted in the hospital 

for   further   dilation   and   evacuation.     Thereafter   the   Product   of 

Conception of the prosecutrix 'P' was collected by the doctor, sealed and 

handed over to the Investigating Officer which was seized vide memo 

Ex.PW1/D.  It is evident from the record that though there was a natural 

abortion  suffered  by  the  prosecutrix 'P' yet the complete dilation and 

evacuation could only take place in the hospital with medical assistance 

and supervision.  
(36)              The   medical   record   of   the   victim   'P'   shows   that   a   sexual 

assault   had   been   committed   on   her   as   a   result   of   which   she   had 

conceived and thereafter the dilation and evacuation was was carried out 

in   the   hospital   and   Product   of   Conception   (POC)   was   collected   and 

preserved by the doctor and handed over to the Investigating Officer. 

The MLC of the victim confirms that the minor had been subjected to 

sexual exploitation and I hold that the medical evidence on record is 

compatible   to   the   history   of   sexual   offence   (Rape)   upon   the   minor 

prosecutrix 'P'.   
 

Forensic Evidence:
(37)              It   is   evident   from   the   record   that   the   exhibits   of   the 

prosecutrix which comprises of the Product of Conception after dilation 

and evacuation were collected at the BSA Hospital which were thereafter 


St. Vs. Tara Chand, FIR No. 150/12, PS S.P. Badli                                    Page No. 27
 sealed and handed over to the Investigating Officer by the doctors were 

sent to FSL for DNA examination.  Initially on 31.10.2012 analysis was 

conducted by Analyst Sh. Dhruv Sharma, Assistant Director (Biology) 

and he reported that the DNA could not be amplified from the exhibits 

of the victim.  However, not being satisfied by the manner in which the 

said report was given the Director FSL and HOD (DNA) were again 

vide order dated 5.12.2012 directed to conduct the fresh analysis of the 

exhibits with specific directions that the Analysis should be carried out 

by the HOD himself.  On 9.1.2013 the fresh DNA Fingerprinting Report 

was   received   from   FSL   wherein   Sh.   A.K.   Shrivastava   HOD   (DNA 

Fingerprinting) reported that he could amplify the DNA from the said 

exhibits of the Product of Conception (i.e. POC collected by the doctor 

pursuant   to  dilation   and  evacuation) by using AmpFL  STR Identifier 

Plus PCR Amplification Kit. Sh. A.K. Shrivastava (PW13) has proved 

the said report which is  Ex.PW13/A  and the Genotype Data which is 

Ex.PW13/B.   According   to   the   DNA   Report  Ex.PW13/A  the   DNA 

Profiling   (STR   Analysis)   performed  on   the  exhibits  provided  was 

sufficient   to   conclude   that   one   set   of   alleles   from   the   source   of 

exhibit   2a   (Product   of   Conception)  and  exhibit  2b  (three pads in 

normal saline of victim) were similar with one set of alleles of the 

source of exhibit 1a (blood of accused) and 1b (blood in gauze of 

accused).  In view of the above, I hereby hold that the forensic evidence 

on   record   is   compatible   to   the   prosecution   case   and   conclusively 

St. Vs. Tara Chand, FIR No. 150/12, PS S.P. Badli                             Page No. 28
 establishes that the aborted fetus of the prosecutrix has been fathered by 

accused Tara Chand and hence connects the accused with the offence.


Allegations against the accused Tara Chand:
(38)              The case of the prosecution is that the accused who is the 

maternal uncle/ Mausa of the child prosecutrix had been exploiting her 

sexually.   The entire prosecution case revolves around the testimony of 

the prosecutrix 'P'.   The prosecutrix 'P' belongs to an extremely poor 

strata of the society and the accused Tara Chand had come to Delhi to 

earn his livelihood.  The parents of the prosecutrix in the background of 

their close relationship and taking pity on accused, not only helped him 

by getting him an employment at the same place (hotel) where the father 

of the prosecutrix was working but also permitted him to stay in their 

house which was a one room tenancy on the first floor.  The father of the 

child   was   a   habitual   alcoholic   and   her   mother   was   a   patient   of 

depression.   The accused Tara Chand taking advantage of the situation 

daily   consumed   alcohol   with   the   father   while   her   mother   consumed 

sleeping pills for her depression before settling down at night.   It was 

then   that   he  used   this  opportunity to sexually exploit the prosecutrix 

after taking her out to the adjoining room which was vacant.  Ironically, 

the   prosecutrix   had   even   told   her   mother   on   one   occasion   about   the 

accused Tara Chand but she refused to believe her in view of their close 

relationship.  The relevant portion of the testimony of the prosecutrix 'P' 

is as under:

                       ".......   I   am   a   student   of   Class   6th  and   studying   in  
                      Sarvodaya Kanya Vidyalaya, Samaypur Badli, Delhi.  
                      My father is a cook in a hotel and my mother is doing  
                      the work of chowka­bartan in the kothies. 
                               The accused Tara Chand who is present in the  
                      court (correctly identified by the witness) is my mausa  
                      being the husband of my real mausi.   About 4 to 5  
                      months prior to the incident, Tara Chand had come to  
                      Delhi and was staying at our house on the asking of  
                      my mausi. Tara Chand was unemployed and my mausi  
                      pleaded   with   my   father   to   get   him   employed  
                      somewhere.   My father who is a cook in a hotel, got  
                      him employed in the same hotel as a cook and Tara  
                      Chand  started staying at our house.  We are on rent  
                      in one room and we all used to sleep together in that  
                      room.    At this stage, the  witness has explained that  
                      there are two rooms in the house and they are staying  
                      in one room on rent whereas the other room remains  
                      vacant as nobody is residing there.  
                               Now   at   this   stage,   the   witness   has   suddenly  
                      stopped speaking and has kept quiet.  On persuasions  
                      from the Court to inform as to what had happened,  
                      she   has   then   slowly   stated  'Tara   Chand   mere   sath  
                      gandi harkat kiya karta tha'.
                      Court   question   :  Tara   Chand   apke   sath   kya   gandi  
                      harkat karta tha ?
                      Ans. Jab mere papa mammi so jate thye, Tara Chand

                      hai?

                      Court question: Kya pata chal gaya tha ?  Kya aapne  
                      doctor ko kuch bataya tha ?
                      Ans.: Pehle maine doctor ko kuch nahi bataya tha  
                      par   baad   mei   jab   doctor   ne   mujhse   poocha   toh

                       period of 2 to 4 months)....."

(39)                In her cross­examination the prosecutrix has explained that 

they   were  residing   as   tenants   in   one   room   whereas   the   other   room 

remained vacant and nobody was residing in the same.  She has further 

explained  that  the  accused used to wake her up at night and nobody 

came to know of the same because her mother used to take sleeping pills 

for her depression treatment and her father and the accused Tara Chand 

used to consume alcohol before sleeping and hence her parents never 

came to know of it.  According to her, she never raised any alarm when 

the   accused   used   to   take   her   to   the   other   room   because   she   was 

extremely   scared   as   the   accused   used   to  show  her   a  knife.    She  has 

admitted that she did not tell any of her friends in the school or her class 

teacher or any other teacher as to what Tara Chand was doing with her 

and explained that at that time she was new in the school and did not 

know anybody there.   The prosecutrix has also explained that on one 

occasion   she   had   tried   to   tell   her   mother   but   her   mother  refused   to 

believe her on the ground that the accused Tara Chand used to love her 

and used to take good care of her.   The relevant portion of her cross­

examination in this regard is as under:
(40)              A specific suggestion has been made to the child victim that 

she had made physical relations with some other person and when her 

parents came to know about the same, in order to save their honour, they 

have falsely implicated the accused Tara Chand.  
(41)             Before evaluating the above statements of the prosecutrix on 

the touch stone of truthfulness and credibility, it is necessary to briefly 

discuss the guiding principles of law as laid down by the various Courts. 

I may observe that the Hon'ble Supreme Court has in the case of State  

of Rajasthan Vs. Biram Lal reported in 2005 AIR (SC) 2327 has held 

that:
(42)              In the year 2006 the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of State  

of Himachal Pradesh Vs. Asha Ram reported in AIR 2006 SC 381 had 

observed that: 
(43)              It was further observed by the Hon'ble Court that: 

(44)              Further,   in   the   case   of  Vishnu   Vs.   State   of   Maharastra 

reported in  2006 AIR (SC) 508  it was observed by the Hon'ble Apex 

Court that:  

                     On the pretext of going to Hospital, he took her to a  
                     hotel, took her inside a room, closed the door of the

                      room, threatened her to finish her if she shouted and  
                     then forcibly ravished her sexually.   A clear case of  
                     rape,   as   defined   under   Section   375   Clause   third   of  
                     IPC was found established against the accused...."


(45)              Also   in   the   case   of  Bharwada   Boginbhai   Hirji   Bhai   Vs.  

State of Gujarat reported in 1983 (CRI) GJX 0252 SC: AIR 1983 SC  

7453   (1)  it   was   observed   by   the   Hon'ble   Supreme   Court   that   in   the 

Indian   setting,   refusal   to   act   on   the   testimony   of   a   victim   of   sexual 

assault   in   the   absence   of   corroboration  as  a  rule,  is   adding  insult   to 

injury.     Why   should   the   evidence   of   the   girl   or   the   woman   who 

complaints of rape or sexual molestation be viewed with doubt, disbelief 

or suspicion?  To do so is to justify charge of male chauvinism in a male 

dominated society.  
(46)              Applying  these settled principles of law to the facts of the 

present case Firstly it is writ large that the victim/ prosecutrix is a minor 

aged about 14­16 years (not even achieved the age of consent).  She was 

sexually exploited over a period of time and had even conceived.  

(47)              Secondly the prosecutrix who was hardly 14 years of age has 

been most specific and categorical in so far as the aspect of consent is 

concerned.   She has stated that the accused had been making relations 

with her under threat.   Even otherwise, the prosecutrix being a minor 

(less than 16 years of age) the question of her consent under the given 

circumstances does not arise.    

St. Vs. Tara Chand, FIR No. 150/12, PS S.P. Badli                                    Page No. 36
 (48)              Thirdly  the   prosecutrix   is   again   very   consistent   in   her 

deposition regarding the manner in which she had been sexually used by 

the   accused   (her   uncle).   She   has   in   her   first   statement   to   the 

Investigating Officer on the basis of which the FIR was registered and 

her later statement to the doctor and then to the Ld. MM under Section 

164 Cr.P.C. and then in the Court has specifically named the accused 

Tara Chand and has been most consistent thereafter.  She has explained 

how Tara Chand took advantage of the addiction of her father to alcohol 

and mother to sleeping pills and hence sexually exploited her for almost 

two to three months.  Understandably the prosecutrix was hardly 12 - 13 

years age at that time and was not even aware of the consequences.  In 

fact she was not even aware that she had conceived and that when she 

fell sick it was because of the abortion which had taken place.   It was 

only when she was taken to the hospital while she complained of severe 

stomach pain and bleeding per vagina that the doctors realized what had 

happened and she disclosed to them what the accused was doing to her. 

The   sequence   of   events   as   narrated   by   the   prosecutrix   appear   to   be 

natural and probable.   The prosecutrix 'P' being of immature age and 

understanding neither raised any alarm nor told anybody of the acts of 

the accused except that on one occasion when she did try to tell her 

mother,   the   mother   refused   to   believe   her   in   view   of   their   close 

relationship with the accused and this, of course, is the biggest mistake 

which any parent can commit.  I find the testimony of the prosecutrix 'P' 


St. Vs. Tara Chand, FIR No. 150/12, PS S.P. Badli                               Page No. 37
 credible,   reliable   &   truthful   because   it   finds   due   corroboration   and 

support from the report of DNA Fingerprinting. 
(49)              Fourthly a suggestion has been made that the prosecutrix 'P' 

had made relations with some other person and even conceived and her 

family in order to save their honour implicated the accused Tara Chand. 

The said suggestion is on the face of it without any basis.   In fact the 

DNA  Fingerprinting   Report  has conclusively nailed the  accused  Tara 

Chand.   Initially the DNA could not be amplified from the exhibits of 

the   victim   but   later   a   fresh   DNA   examination   of   the   exhibits   was 

directed to got conducted pursuant to which DNA profile was generated 

by using   AmpFL  STR Identifier Plus PCR  Amplification kit and the 

DNA could be successfully amplified.   The fresh DNA Fingerprinting 

Report which is Ex.PW13/A establishes that one set of alleles from the 

source of exhibit 2a (Product of Conception) and exhibit 2b (three pads 

in normal saline of victim) were similar with one set of alleles of the 

source   of   exhibit   1a   (blood   of   accused)   and   1b   (blood   in   gauze   of 

accused).   It is this DNA Fingerprinting Report which confirms that it 

was in fact the accused Tara Chand who had been sexually exploiting the 

victim and the aborted fetus of the victim/ prosecutrix had been fathered 

by the accused Tara Chand.
(50)              Lastly  the   prosecutrix   'P'   has   specifically   deposed   that   on 

account of the threats executed by the accused Tara Chand who kept a 

knife on her that  she did not disclose about the incident to anybody. 


St. Vs. Tara Chand, FIR No. 150/12, PS S.P. Badli                                  Page No. 38
 There is no reason to disbelieve the prosecutrix in this regard.  She has 

been most specific and consistent in her allegations against the accused 

with regard to the threats being executed to her and it is apparently on 

account of the same that she did not disclose about the same to anybody.

(51)              In view of the above, I hereby hold that the prosecution has 

been able to prove and substantiate the allegations against the accused 

Tara   Chand   of   having   committed   rape   upon   the   prosecutrix   'P'   and 

having criminally intimidated her for which the accused Tara Chand is 

held   guilty   of   the   offence   under  Section   376  and  506   Indian   Penal 

Code.

FINAL CONCLUSION:
(52)              In   the   case   of  Sharad   Birdhichand   Sarda   Vs.   State   of  

Maharastra,  reported in  AIR 1984 SC 1622,  the Apex Court has laid 

down   the   tests   which   are   pre­requisites   before   conviction   should   be 

recorded, which are as under:
St. Vs. Tara Chand, FIR No. 150/12, PS S.P. Badli                                       Page No. 39
                  4. They   should   exclude   every   possible   hypothesis  
                    except the one to be proved; and 
                 5. There must be a chain of evidence so complete as  
                    not   to   leave   any   reasonable   ground   for   the  
                    conclusion   consistent   with   the   innocence   of   the  
                    accused   and   must   show   that   in   all   human  
                    probability   the   act   must   have   been   done   by   the  
                    accused.

(53)                 Applying the above principles of law to the present case it is 

evident   that   the  investigation   conducted   including   the   documents 

prepared in the present case have been substantially proved by the police 

witnesses including the first and the second investigating officers.   On 

the basis of the evidence on record the following facts stand established:


           ➢          That  about  four to five months prior to the incident, the 

                      accused  Tara   Chand   had   come   to   Delhi   for   earning   his

                       livelihood.
           ➢          That   since   the   accused   Tara   Chand   was   unemployed   the 

                      Mausi of the prosecutrix pleaded with her father to get him 

                      employed somewhere on which the father of the prosecutrix 

                      got the accused employed in the same hotel as a Cook and 

                      Tara Chand started staying at their house.  
           ➢          That the prosecutrix and her family used to sleep together 

                      in one room only. 
           ➢          That before sleeping the father of the prosecutrix 'P' and the 

                      accused Tara Chand used to consume alcohol daily and the 

                      mother of the prosecutrix 'P' was addicted to sleeping pills 

                      on account of her depression.
           ➢          That   when   the  parents  of   the  prosecutrix  'P'   went   off   to 

                      sleep,   the   accused  Tara  Chand  used   to  wake  her  up  and 

                      asked her to come outside and used to commit rape upon 

                      the prosecutrix.
           ➢          That   the   prosecutrix   'P'   did   not   tell   anything   about   the 

                      incident to anybody since Tara Chand used to threat her not 

                      do disclose the incident to anybody or else he would stab 

                      her father.
           ➢          That   on   one   occasion   the   prosecutrix   'P'   told   about   the

           ➢          That it was thereafter that the prosecutrix 'P' informed the 

                      doctors about being sexually exploited by her Mausa Tara 

                      Chand.
           ➢          That on the basis of the statement of the prosecutrix 'P' the 

                      present case was got registered and the accused Tara Chand 

                      was arrested.

(54)              The   medical   evidence   on   record   establishes  that   a   sexual 

assault   had   been   committed   on   her   as   a   result   of   which   she   had 

conceived and there was a natural abortion and in the hospital dilation 

and   evacuation   had   been   carried   out   after   which   the   Product   of 

Conception (POC) was presented and handed over to the Investigating

 Officer.     The   DNA   Fingerprinting   Report   establishes   that   one   set   of 

alleles from the source of exhibit 2a (Product of Conception) and exhibit 

2b (three pads in normal saline of victim) were similar with one set of 

alleles of the source of exhibit 1a (blood of accused) and 1b (blood in 

gauze of accused), which confirms that it was in fact the accused Tara 

Chand who had been sexually exploiting the victim and the aborted fetus 

of the victim/ prosecutrix had been fathered by the accused Tara Chand.

(55)              There are two stages in the criminal prosecution.   The first 

obviously   is   the   commission   of   the   crime   and   the   second   is   the 

investigation conducted regarding the same.  In case the investigation is 

faulty or has not been proved in evidence at trial, the question which 

arise is  whether it would absolve the liability of the culprit who has 

committed the offence? The answer is obviously in negative, since any 

lapse on the part of the investigation does not negate the offence.  

(56)              The prosecution has proved the identity of the accused, the 

manner in which the offence has been committed, place of commission 

of   the   offence,   the   investigation   including   the   documents   prepared, 

MLC,   etc.     There  is   nothing  which  could  shatter  the   veracity  of   the 

prosecution  witnesses or falsify the claim of the prosecution. All the 

prosecution   witnesses   have  materially  supported   the   prosecution   case 

and the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses do not suffer from any 

infirmity,   inconsistency   or   contradiction   and   are   consistent   and 

corroborative.  The evidence of the prosecution witnesses is natural and 


St. Vs. Tara Chand, FIR No. 150/12, PS S.P. Badli                            Page No. 43
 trustworthy and corroborated by medical and forensic evidence and the 

witness of the prosecution have been able to built up a continuous link.  

(57)              In view of the above, I hereby hold that the  prosecution has 

been able to prove and substantiate the allegations against the accused 

Tara   Chand   of   having   committed   rape   upon   the   prosecutrix   'P'   and 

having criminally intimidated her for which the accused Tara Chand is 

held   guilty   of   the   offence   under  Section   376  and  506   Indian   Penal 

Code and accordingly convicted.

 ORDER ON SENTENCE:
                     Child sexual abuse are dark realities in Indian society like in 

any   other   nation.   53   per   cent   of   our   children   are   sexually   abused, 

according to a statistic from a survey done by the Government of India. 

A 1985 study by the Tata Institute of Social Sciences reveals that one out 

of three girls and one out of 10 boys had been sexually abused as a child. 

50%   of   child   sexual   abuse   happens   at   home.     In   1996,   Samvada,   a 

Bangalore based NGO, conducted a study among 348 girls.  15% were 

used for masturbation mostly by male relatives when they were less than 

10 years old.  75% of the abusers were adult family members. A report 

from RAHI, (Recovering and Healing from Incest), a Delhi based NGO 

working   with   child   sexual   abuse   titled   Voices   from   the   Silent   Zone 

suggests that nearly three­quarters of upper and middle class Indian girls 

are abused by a family member often by an uncle, a cousin or an elder 

brother.  
                     This case relates to  intra familial sex abuse  (Incest) of a 

minor aged about 12 years by her maternal uncle as a consequence of 

which she conceived.   The offence was only exposed when the victim 

suffered a natural abortion and was hospitalized for treatment of stomach 

pain when the sexual abuse of the child became knowledge to the doctor 

and to the family of the victim child.   The accused Tara Chand is the 

maternal uncle/ Mausa of the child prosecutrix 'P' who belongs to an 

extremely poor strata of the society.  He had come to Delhi to earn his 


St. Vs. Tara Chand, FIR No. 150/12, PS S.P. Badli                              Page No. 46
 livelihood and the parents of the prosecutrix in the background of their 

close relationship and taking pity on accused, not only helped him by 

getting him an employment at the same place (hotel) where the father of 

the prosecutrix was working but also permitted him to stay in their house 

which was a one room tenancy on the first floor.  The father of the child 

was a habitual alcoholic and her mother was a patient of depression. 

The accused Tara Chand used to consume alcohol daily with the father 

of the victim while her mother was addicted to sleeping pills for her 

depression.   The   accused   taking   advantage   of   this   situation     sexually 

exploited   the   prosecutrix   after   taking   her   out   to   the   adjoining   room 

which was vacant.  Ironically, the prosecutrix had even told her mother 

on one occasion about the bad intentions of the accused Tara Chand but 

she (mother) refused to believe her in view of their close relationship.

                     The   prosecutrix   'P'   had   appeared   in  the   Court   and   made 

specific allegations against the accused Tara Chand.  On the basis of the 

testimonies   of   the   various   prosecution   witnesses   particularly   the 

prosecutrix 'P' and her parents and also on the basis of the medical and 

forensic evidence which has come on record, this Court vide a detailed 

judgment   dated   10.1.2013   held   the   accused   Tara   Chand   guilty   of   the 

offence under Section 376 and 506 Indian Penal Code and accordingly 

convicted.   It has been observed by this Court that it stood established 

that the prosecutrix 'P' belongs to a very poor family who were residing 

in one room tenancy; that the father of the prosecutrix 'P' is working in a 


St. Vs. Tara Chand, FIR No. 150/12, PS S.P. Badli                                  Page No. 47
 hotel  as Cook   and  the mother of  the prosecutrix is working as maid 

servant in Kothies; that at the time of the incident the prosecutrix was 

aged about 13­14 years and was studying in Sarvodaya Kanya Vidyalaya, 

Samaypur Badli, Delhi in class 6th; that the accused Tara Chand is the 

Mausa (husband of mother's sister) of the prosecutrix; that about four to 

five months prior to the incident, the accused Tara Chand had come to 

Delhi for earning his livelihood; that since the accused Tara Chand was 

unemployed the Mausi of the prosecutrix pleaded with her father to get 

him employed somewhere on which the father of the prosecutrix got the 

accused employed in the same hotel as a Cook and Tara Chand started 

staying at their house; that the prosecutrix and her family used to sleep 

together   in   one   room   only;   that   before   sleeping   the   father   of   the 

prosecutrix   'P' and  the  accused Tara Chand used to consume alcohol 

daily while the mother of the prosecutrix 'P' was addicted to sleeping 

pills   on   account   of   her   depression;   that   when   the   parents   of   the 

prosecutrix 'P' went off to sleep, the accused Tara Chand used to wake 

her up and asked her to come outside and used to commit rape upon the 

prosecutrix;   that   the   prosecutrix   'P'   did   not   tell   anything   about   the 

incident to anybody since Tara Chand used to threat her not do disclose 

the incident to anybody or else he would stab her father; that on one 

occasion the prosecutrix 'P' told about the incident to her mother but she 

refused   to   believe   her;   that   on   1.5.2012   the   prosecutrix   'P'   started 

complaining her father about pain in her abdomen on which she was 


St. Vs. Tara Chand, FIR No. 150/12, PS S.P. Badli                               Page No. 48
 taken to Baba Sahib Ambedkar Hospital with a history of  complaining 

of pain in abdomen and bleeding per vagina for five days and history of 

passage   of   some   fleshy   mass   per   vagina   at   home;   that   on   medical 

examination it was found that the prosecutrix 'P' was pregnant (her UPT 

was positive), slight bleeding per vagina was found positive, her hymen 

was torn, cervical OS was closed and uterus was found ante­verted & 

normal size; that it was thereafter that the prosecutrix 'P' informed the 

doctors about being sexually exploited by her Mausa (Maternal Uncle) 

Tara Chand; that on the basis of the statement of the prosecutrix 'P' the 

present   case   was   got   registered   and   the   accused   Tara   Chand   was 

arrested.
                     It   has   also   been   observed   that   the  medical   evidence   on 

record established that a sexual assault had been committed on her as a 

result of which she had conceived and there was a natural abortion and 

in the hospital Dilation and Evacuation had been carried out after which 

the Product of Conception (POC) was preserved and handed over to the 

Investigating   Officer.   Further,   the   DNA   Fingerprinting   Report 

established   that   one   set   of   alleles   from   the   source   of   exhibit   2(a) 

(Product of Conception) and exhibit 2(b) (three pads in normal saline of 

victim) were similar with one set of alleles of the source of exhibit 1(a) 

(blood of accused) and 1(b) (blood in gauze of accused), which confirms 

that   it   was   in   fact   the   accused   Tara   Chand   who   had   been   sexually 

exploiting the victim and the aborted fetus of the victim/ prosecutrix had 


St. Vs. Tara Chand, FIR No. 150/12, PS S.P. Badli                                  Page No. 49
 been  fathered  by  the  accused Tara Chand.   In view of the above the 

accused Tara Chand has been held guilty of the offence under  Section 

376 and 506 Indian Penal Code and accordingly convicted.

                     Heard arguments on the point of sentence.  The convict Tara 

Chand is stated to be aged about 29 years, having a family comprising of 

aged father, wife and one son aged about three years.  He is 5th class pass 

and is a Cook by profession.  Ld. Amicus Curiae has vehemently argued 

that the convict is the only earning member of his family and all his 

family members are dependent upon him.   He requests that a lenient 

view be taken against him.  
                     On the other hand, the Additional Public Prosecutor for the 

State has requested for the maximum sentence to be imposed upon the 

convict submitting that the convict Tara Chand who is the Mausa of the 

prosecutrix 'P' has committed "intrafamilial child sexual abuse" upon 

the prosecutrix and hence, deserves no leniency.   The prosecutrix and 

her   family   were   also   heard   on   the   aspects   of   present   status   and 

rehabilitation of the victim.  The prosecutrix has informed me that she 

has again started her studies and presently she is studying in class 6th at 

Sarvodaya Kanya Vidyalya, Badli.   Her father has submitted that he is 

working   as   a   Cook   at   Jai   Vaishno   Rasoi,   B­Block   Market,   Prashant 

Vihar  at   a   monthly   salary of  Rs.8,000/­  and is having three children 

including the prosecutrix two of whom are studying and the youngest is 

still aged about 2 ½ years.   His wife (mother of the prosecutrix) is a 

St. Vs. Tara Chand, FIR No. 150/12, PS S.P. Badli                           Page No. 50
 chronic patient of Depression who was previously working as a part time 

domestic help but is now confined at home.   He has further informed 

that after her testimony was recorded in the Court he has now again got 

the prosecutrix admitted in class 6th  so that she can continue with her 

studies.   However, being a poor person he is not very optimistic as to 

how long he will be able to bear the financial burden relating to the 

studies of the prosecutrix.  
                     I have considered the rival contentions.   The Delhi High 

Court in the case of Khem Chand Vs. State of Delhi reported in 2008  

(IV) JCC 2497 enumerated the principle factors to be taken into account 

by   the   courts   while   assessing   as   to   what   could   be   the   appropriate 

sentence   in   a   given   case.     Some   of   the   factors   enumerated   are   (i) 

Criminal   and   Crime,   (ii)   Manner   of   Commission   of   offence,   (iii) 

Violence   involved,   (iv)   Whether   the   offender   or   accused   was   in   a 

position of fiduciary, trust or exploited a social or family relationship, 

(v) State of victim, impact of crime on the victim.  

                     The Hon'ble Supreme Court while considering the question 

of quantum of sentence in the case of State of Rajasthan Vs. Gajender  

Singh reported in 2008 (III) JCC 2061 observed as under:


                     The Hon'ble Apex Court has time and again stressed upon 

the need for awarding the punishment for a crime which should not be 

irrelevant but should be conform to and be consistent with the atrocity 

and   the   brutality   with   which   the   crime   has   been   perpetrated,   the 

enormity of the crime warranting public abhorrence of the crime and 

responding   to   the   society's   cry   for   justice   against   the   criminal.   (Ref. 

Rajiv Vs. State of Rajasthan reported in 1996 (II) SCC 175).

                     The object of sentence is not only required to be reformative 

but it should also  be punitive, preventive and deterrent.   The hon'ble 

Supreme Court has while considering the sentencing policy in the case 

of Siddarama and Ors. Vs. State of Karnataka reported in 2006 IV AD  

(Crl.) SC 78 has observed that:

                 Friedman in his "Law in Changing Society" stated  


St. Vs. Tara Chand, FIR No. 150/12, PS S.P. Badli                                        Page No. 52
                  that,   "State   of   criminal   law   continues   to   be   as   it  
                 should   be   a   decisive   reflection   of   social  
                 unconsciousness of society".  Therefore, in operating  
                 the   sentencing   system,   law   should   adopt   the  
                 corrective   machinery   or   the   deterrence   based   on  
                 factual   matrix.     By   deft   modulation   sentencing  
                 process be stern where it should be, and tempered  
                 with mercy where it warrants to be.   The facts and  
                 given circumstances in each case, the nature of the  
                 crime,   the   manner   in   which   it   was   planned   and  
                 committed, the move for commission of the crime, the  
                 conduct   of   the   accused,   and   all   other   attending  
                 circumstances are relevant facts which would enter  
                 into the area of consideration......"
                 The Hon'ble Court has further observed that:
                 "...........The criminal law adheres in general to the  
                 principle   of   proportionality   in   prescribing   liability  
                 according to the culpability of each kind of criminal  
                 conduct.     It   ordinarily   allows   some   significant  
                 discretion the the judge in arriving at a sentence in  
                 each   case,   presumably   to   permit   sentences   that  
                 reflect   more   subtle   considerations   culpability   that  
                 are raised by the special facts of each case.  Judges  
                 in essence affirm that punishment ought always to fit  
                 the crime; yet in practice sentences are determined  
                 largely by other considerations.  Sometimes it is the  
                 correctional needs of the perpetrator that are offered  
                 to justify a sentence.   Sometimes the desirability of  
                 keeping him out of circulation and sometimes even  
                 the   tragic   results   of   his   crime.     Inevitably   these  
                 considerations cause a departure from just desert as  
                 the basis of punishment and create cases of apparent  
                 injustice that are serious and widespread......"

St. Vs. Tara Chand, FIR No. 150/12, PS S.P. Badli                                         Page No. 53
                  "......Proportion between crime and punishment is a  
                 goal   respected   in  principle,   and   in  spite  of   errant  
                 notions,   it   remains   a   strong   influence   in   the  
                 determination   of   sentences.     The   practice   of  
                 punishing   all   serious   crime   with   equal   severity   is  
                 now   unknown   in   civilized   societies,   but   such   a  
                 radical   departure   from   the   principle   of  
                 proportionality has disappeared from the law only in  
                 recent times.  Even now for a single grave infraction  
                 drastic sentences are imposed.  Anything less than a  
                 penalty of greatest severity for any serious crime is  
                 through  then   to  be a measure of toleration that  is  
                 unwarranted   and  unwise.     But   in fact,  quite apart  
                 from   those   considerations   that   make   punishment  
                 unjustifiable   when   it   is   out   of   proportion   to   the  
                 crime,   uniformly   disproportionate   punishment   had  
                 some very undesirable practice consequences.."


                      The offence of rape is barbaric in nature where the victim is 

ravished like an animal for the fulfillment of desire and lust of another 

man.  Hon'ble Mr. Justice Arijit Pasayat (Judge Supreme Court of India) 

had rightly observed that a murderer destroys the physical frame of the 

victim whereas the rapist degrades and defiles the soul of a helpless 

female.  As per the official statistics a total number of 568 cases of rape 

have been reported in Delhi alone in the year 2011 out of which only 2% 

have been committed by strangers.  The figure would be much high but 

most of the cases are not reported by the victims because of the various 

reasons   such   as   family   pressure,   behaviour   of   the   police,   the 

unreasonably   long   and   unjust   process   and   application   of   law   and 

St. Vs. Tara Chand, FIR No. 150/12, PS S.P. Badli                                      Page No. 54
 resulting consequences thereof.
                      Of late instances of young girls of impressionable age being 

sexually exploited are on a rise and this, I may observe, is a matter of 

national concern.  The primary obligation of the Courts is to ensure that 

minors are protected from all kind of exploitations.   The convict Tara 

Chand is closely related to the family of the prosecutrix 'P' being her 

real mausa (husband of the mother's sister).   The prosecutrix 'P' was 

hardly aged 13­14 years at the time of the incident.   The convict Tara 

Chand had come to Delhi for earning his livelihood and being a close 

relative the parents of the prosecutrix got him employed at the same 

hotel where the father of the prosecutrix was working and also permitted 

him to stay in their house which was a one room tenancy on the first 

floor.     The   convict   Tara   Chand   taking   advantage   of   the   faith   of   the 

parents   of   the   prosecutrix   'P'   exploited   the   prosecutrix   sexually   as   a 

result of which at a young age of 13­14 years when the prosecutrix 'P' 

should   have   been   seriously   involved   into   studies   and   preparing   for 

herself for a good future, she conceived from the convict.   Assuming 

that all this happened with the consent of the minor prosecutrix 'P' yet 

the   law   of   this   Country   protects   the   minors   and   her   consent   is 

inconsequential  and immaterial.   What the convict has done with the 

minor prosecutrix 'P' is unpardonable and under these circumstances, no 

leniency can be shown to the convict. 
                      Another  argument raised by the convict Tara Chand while 


St. Vs. Tara Chand, FIR No. 150/12, PS S.P. Badli                                Page No. 55
 pleading for lesser punishment is that by reason of intoxication he was 

incapable of knowing the nature of the act or that what he was doing 

was wrong or contrary to law and hence he has pleaded for leniency. 

The   argument   so   advanced   though   deserves   outright   rejection   but 

looking at the present scenario where day in and day out sexual abuse of 

women and children is happening and is on the rise, I feel constrained to 

deal with this argument with certain facts and figures based on Global 

Scientific Research which proves that there are linkages between patrons 

of alcohol abuse and crime.   Alcohol is by a wide margin, the biggest 

law enforcement problem world­over.   The data supplied by  National  

Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, National Institute of Mental  

Health   -   USA  and  Task   Force   Report:   Drunkenness,  President's 

Commission on Law Enforcement and Administration of Justice - USA 

shows that most of the crimes including Homicide, Domestic Violence 

and Sexual Abuse are alcohol related crimes.  According to Center for  

Disease Control and Prevention, Alcohol and Public Health Fact Sheet  

-   Binge   Drinking   (extreme   alcohol   consumption)   is   becoming   an 

increasing problem in most countries.  Alcohol is a great contributory to 

psychological as well as physical damage and most of the time alcohol is 

an easy excuse for a domestic abuser.  Research material also shows the 

incidents of domestic abuse in households, where there is alcohol abuse 

is a lot higher and the abusers name the effects of alcohol as their main 

cause of violence.

                      Alcohol   is   a   mind   altering   drug   which   can   cause   an 

individual to do something which they would not have done otherwise. 

This does not refer to loosened inhibitions, but also extends to harmful 

acts against themselves and others.  Research conducted by Dr. Richard 

H.   Blum   concludes   that   alcohol   plays   a   causal   role   as   one   of   the 

necessary   and   precipitating   elements   for   violence.   Such   a   role   is   in 

keeping  with   the most  probable effects of alcohol  as a depressant  of 

inhibition control centers in the brain, leading to release of impulses. 

Increase   alcohol   abuse   is   associated   with   clean   and   significant 

increasing rates of violent crimes.   As a society we cannot ignore the 

casual association between alcohol abuse and Juvenile offence.

                     Scientific   Research   have   also   proved   that   Alcohol   with 

coverage of Nicotine and Caffeine have an extremely harmful effect on 

human   body.   Consumption   of   certain   alcohol   beverages   (particularly 

laced   with   Caffeine)   cause   an   aggressive   behaviour   by   exacerbate 

preexisting propensities for aggressivity.   Eriksson & C.J. Peter in the 

year   2008   confirmed   by   research   the   role   of   alcohol   on   aggressive 

human behaviour and sex abuse (Ref:­The Role of Alcohol on Physical 

and Cognitive Functions).   Researcher Eriksson also explored how sex 

hormones mediate aggressivity. (Ref: Hormones and Social behaviour 

edited by Donald W. Pfaff, Claude Kordon, Philippe Chanson and Yves 

Christen).  
                     Based   on   the   above   research   prohibition   on   alcohol   has 


St. Vs. Tara Chand, FIR No. 150/12, PS S.P. Badli                                 Page No. 57
 become   a   serious   policy   issue   world   over   and   has   been   favourably 

recognized  both from humanitarian as well as societal point of view. 

Many States have acknowledged that it is useless to prohibit other drugs 

including heroin so long as alcohol remains freely available but at the 

same time it has been felt that a total ban / prohibition on alcohol is 

impracticable.  Currently a few countries have given a serious thought to 

this problem and have devised various policies relating to alcohol sale 

and consumption which include a policy of 'High Price', 'Increasing Age  

of Consumption', 'Quality (contents of alcoholic drinks being sold and  

consumed) of as well as Quantity (amount of alcohol available in free  

market) Check and Control, or even 'ban' (partial / complete).   In the 

year 2011 a few Islamic countries like  Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, 

the  United   Arab   Emirates,   Iran  and  Gaza  have  imposed   a  ban  on 

alcohol consumption. Ban on alcohol has an impact on health of every 

individual.   Recently   four   States   in   Obama   Administration   i.e. 

Washington,   Michigan,   Utah  and  Oklahoma  have   banned   many 

beverages   containing   high   alcohol   contents   and   other   States   are   also 

considering a similar action.   Food and Drug Administration in USA 

have   notified   a   number   of   caffeinated   alcoholic   beverages   and   has 

banned them because addition of caffeine to alcohol is unsafe and has to 

be outlawed. Caffeinated alcoholic drinks such as Four Loko, Joose and 

Tilt  were   the   most   popular.     Their   consumption   was   associated   with 

increased   risk   of   serious   injury,   drunken   driving,   sexual   assault   and 

St. Vs. Tara Chand, FIR No. 150/12, PS S.P. Badli                             Page No. 58
 other abnormal behavior and hence there is a total Ban on caffeinated 

alcoholic beverages in the West.
                     It is neither for the Government nor for the Court to indulge 

into moral policing but since the question is of life, liberty, safety and 

security of individuals on account of abuse of freedom by a section of 

persons and it is the Government who has been entrusted a duty to make 

informed   decisions   instead   of   the   individuals   and   to   protect   the 

individuals,   then   it   is   right   to   allow   them   (Government)   to   take   all 

decisions necessary to bring about prohibition of beverages, drinks and 

drugs which are harmful by suitable policies.   The state is obligated, 

when the health, safety and security of the citizens is on the line, to pass 

laws and regulations that protect them.  The right of a citizen is not to 

have   drugs   but   the   right   is   to   be   protected   from   harmful   effects   of 

substances,   not   merely   on   their   own   bodies   but   on   the   society   as   a 

whole.  Governments would be derelict in their duties if they do not act 

to remove such harmful substances from the society.   Interestingly in 

India contrary to the Constitutional Mandate (Article 47 of Constitution 

of   India)  providing   that   the   endeavor   of   the   State   is   to  bring   about 

prohibition of the consumption, only four States i.e. Gujarat, Manipur, 

Mizoram  and  Nagaland  as well as Union Territory of Lakshadweep 

prohibit manufacture, sale and consumption of alcohol whereas all other 

Indian   states   permit   manufacture,   sale   and   consumption   of   alcohol. 

Gujarat has a sumptry law in force that prescribes the sale, purchase and 

St. Vs. Tara Chand, FIR No. 150/12, PS S.P. Badli                                 Page No. 59
 consumption of alcoholic drinks. The legislation has been in force since 

May   1,   1960   when   the   Bombay   State   dissolved   into   Maharastra   and 

Gujarat.  Gujarat is the only state in India that has the death penalty for 

those found guilty of making and selling spurious liquor which causes 

death   [Bombay   Prohibition   (Gujarat   Amendment)   Bill,   2009].     This 

linkage of drug abuse and crime has also been widely acknowledged by 

a large number of political parties and it is for this reason that in the year 

1996, the Haryana Vikas Party (headed by Bansi Lal) after being elected 

to   the   Legislative   Assembly   made   it   illegal   to   buy,   sell,   consume   or 

produce alcohol in the state of Haryana and imposed a total prohibition 

in the entire State.   However, on account of political compulsions this 

ban was later lifted.  
                     It   has   to   be   acknowledged   that   there   is   a   definite   link 

between the consumption of alcohol particularly caffeinated alcohol i.e. 

Substance Abuse and rise in crime including those relating to aggressive 

sexual behaviour and the State cannot shy­away from its responsibility. 

The situation in India is still emerging and substance abuse is common 

in slum clusters in all urban localities. Most violent crimes, including 

crimes of sexual nature, have witnessed concomitant Substance Abuse 

(consumption of alcohol with coverage of Nicotine, Caffeine or other 

substances which is much more dangerous than Alcohol Abuse alone). 

In   view   of   the   above   discussion,   it   would   be   imperative   for   the 

Authorities   to   check   the   demand   and   supply   of   illicit   liquor   in   the 


St. Vs. Tara Chand, FIR No. 150/12, PS S.P. Badli                                      Page No. 60
 country. A city like Delhi needs special attention as a large number of 

'Professional' bootleggers are flourishing here. The idea that they might 

be spiking their drinks with substances like Caffeine & Nicotine (being 

cheaply   available)   to   enhance   the   'Kick'   associated   with   the   drink, 

cannot be ruled out.  The issue relating to alcohol consumption does not 

appear to be high on the priority of the State and perhaps it is for this 

reason that manufacture, sale and consumption of alcohol falls within 

the   direct   purview   and   jurisdiction   of   Department   of   Industries 

(Department   of   Entertainment   in   some   states)   whereas   the   Food   & 

Drugs   Department   or   even   Home   Department   appears   to   be   having 

nothing   or   very   little   to   do   with   the   same   and   this   I   am   pained   to 

observe, is despite all serious concerns being raised regarding health, 

safety and security of the citizens (Law and Order). No doubt, the drinks 

Industry   is   an   enormous   global   industry   providing   employment   to 

thousands and large revenue to the Government and any Prohibition / 

Ban   to   alcohol   (either   partial   or   total)   would   adversely   affect   major 

source of funding for public services and tax revenues but this cannot be 

permitted at the cost of Public Health, Security, Safety and Morality. It is 

necessary   for   the   State   to   recognize   this   as   an   important   health   and 

safety issue and perhaps to revisit the existing governmental policies in 

this regard, least it is these people themselves (one's who are indulging 

into Alcohol and Substance Abuse) who start blaming the Government 

for their condition.

                       Coming now to the case in hand, let me now justify my 

earlier observations where I have said that the argument of the convict 

deserves outright rejection, I need not to go very far.  The answer to the 

argument can be found in the provisions of  Sections 85  Indian Penal 

Code  which provides that    Nothing is an offence which is done by a  

person   who,   at   the   time   of   doing   it,   is,   by   reason   of   intoxication,  

incapable of knowing the nature of the act, or that he is doing what is  

either   wrong,   or   contrary   to   law;   provided   that   the   thing   which  

intoxicated   him   was   administered   to   him   without   his   knowledge   or  

against his will.   Further, the provisions of  Section 86 of Indian Penal 

Code provide that  in cases where an act done is not an offence unless  

done with a particular knowledge or intent, a person who does the act in  

a state of intoxication shall be liable to be dealt with as if he had the  

same knowledge as he would have had if he had not been intoxicated,  

unless the thing which intoxicated him was administered to him without  

his knowledge or against his will.   It is clear from the above that the 

statutory law of this land protects only such offenders who have been 

intoxicated without their knowledge or against their will.  Impliedly the 

sections do not come to the aid of such an offender who voluntarily 

consumes alcohol and then commits the offence.  These provisions are 

based upon the sound principle of Justice for a person cannot be allowed 

to take advantage of his own wrong and hence the convict Tara Chand 

cannot turn around to claim that his acts were outcome of whatever he 

St. Vs. Tara Chand, FIR No. 150/12, PS S.P. Badli                                  Page No. 62
 was  consuming  being  freely available in the market.   Here is a case 

where the convict Tara Chand aged about 29 years had been regularly 

and unashamedly raping his own niece hardly aged 13­14 years after 

voluntarily consuming alcohol. Not only did he violate the body of child 

/ minor but he also tormented her mentally and played treachery with 

the family of the child who had given him shelter. Let alone leniency he 

deserves   exemplary   punishment   and   hence  I   award   the   following 

sentences to the convict Tara Chand:

1.      For the offence under Section 376 Indian Penal Code the convict 

        is sentenced to  Rigorous Imprisonment for Life  and fine to the 

        tune of Rs.10,000/­.  In default of payment of fine the convict shall 

        further undergo Simple Imprisonment for a further period of One 

        Month. 
2.      For the offence under Section 506 Indian Penal Code the convict 

        is sentenced to Rigorous Imprisonment a period of Two Years.  

                      Both   the   sentences   shall   run   concurrently.   Benefit   of 

Section   428   Code   of   Criminal   Procedure   shall   be   given   to   the 

convict for the period already undergone by him during the trial, as 

per rules.  
                     Coming now to the aspect of compensation to the victim, I 

may observe that rape of a minor not only affects her alone but such an 


St. Vs. Tara Chand, FIR No. 150/12, PS S.P. Badli                                Page No. 63
 incident leaves a devastating impact on her entire family who equally 

suffer in silence. The victim at the time of the incident was hardly aged 

13­14 years.   It is cases like these which the Ministry of Women and 

Child   development   needs   to   target   for  Restorative   Justice  so   that 

necessary support is provided to the victim.   The Hon'ble Apex Court 

has   time   and   again   observed   that   the   subordinate   Courts   trying   the 

offences   of   sexual   assault   have   the   jurisdiction   to   award   the 

compensation to the victims being an offence against the basic human 

right and violative of Article 21 of the Constitution of India.  It has been 

so observed by Hon'ble Mr. Justice S. Saghir Ahmed and Justice Kuldip 

Singh (Ref: Bodhisattwa Gautam Vs. Subhra Chakraborty reported in 

AIR 1996 SC 922)  that the jurisdiction to pay compensation (interim 

and final) has to be treated to be a part of the over all jurisdiction of the 

Courts   trying   the   offences   of   rape   which   is   an  offence   against   basic 

human rights as also the Fundamental Rights of Personal Liberty and 

Life.  
                     Therefore   in   order   to   provide  Restorative   and  

Compensatory Justice to the victim who requires medical attention and 

rehabilitation,   I   hereby   direct   the   GNCT   of   Delhi   through  Principal 

Secretary (Home) to grant a compensation to the tune of Rs.1,00,000/­ 

(Rs.   One  Lac)   to   the   victim  'P'  daughter  of   Sh. Jogender  Arya, R/o  

B­486, Gali No.7, Suraj Park, Rohini Delhi which amount shall be used 

for   her   welfare   and   rehabilitation   under   the   supervision   of   Welfare
