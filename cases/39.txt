She further deposed that       Rajinder, (PW6-A), the driver had

closed one and her cries could not be heard outside.                                    She

denied that she wanted to marry accused but he refused, so

she framed him in this case.

had informed the prosecutrix that he is going to take a bath

and he would then take her to Chanakya Puri. However, when

working in the house of Mrs. Vidyut Gulati for the last about 4

years. Mrs. Gulati used to go out of station with her family and

          PW8 Ms. Vidyut Gulati deposed that accused was

employed as a cook by her about four years back and the

prosecutrix used to look after her baby. One Rajender was her

driver. On 20-8-2011 she along with her family had gone to

Nanital leaving behind the prosecutrix and accused in the

house. She had instructed her driver Rajender PW6-A to drop

the prosecutrix at her parent's house at Chanakya Puri, New

father about the incident. She returned to Delhi, the next day.

Gulati, deposed that on 20-8-2011, he had received a call

early in the morning that his daughter, Vidyut Gulati, since is

going to hill station so the prosecutrix, her maid servant would

be dropped to his place by her driver.                    At about 8 AM he

received a call from the prosecutrix on his land line.                                  The

prosecutrix was shouting and weeping and was taking the

name of Avdesh that he has done something to her. She told

telephoned the prosecutrix asking her to open the door. The

prosecutrix then opened the door and told him that accused

had raped her. He called the police. Both the accused and

the prosecutrix were sent for their medical examination and

then the accused was arrested.
          During his cross examination, he deposed that he had

not seen any injuries on the person of accused but the

prosecutrix was found hysterical and was crying.

          A bare perusal of the statements of public witnesses

would show that all the witnesses are corroborating with each

other. The witnesses have proved by their depositions that on

20-8-2011 in the morning Mrs. Vidhut Gulati, the employer of

the prosecutrix had left for Nanital with her family, leaving

behind the prosecutrix and the accused in her flat with

instruction to her driver PW6-A Rajender to take the

prosecutrix to the house of her father, namely, Shri Yashwant

 Shri Yashwant.                 The prosecutrix, as was going to take her

bath, was caught by accused Avdesh who took her to the

master bed room of the said flat and despite the resistance of

the prosecutrix, raped her without her consent. After the act

the accused went away. The prosecutrix immediately went to

another room, locked her and telephoned Shri Yashwant

Malhotra, the father of Smt Vidhut Gulati and called him to the

said flat.
          PW11 Shri Yashwant Malhotra rushed to the flat of his

daughter and apprehended the accused. He asked the

prosecutrix to open the door. The prosecutrix came out of the

said locked room and narrated the entire incident to PW11

officials came there ; apprehended the accused and then both

the accused and the prosecutrix were taken to Safdarjung

Hospital for their medical examination.

          The      statement        Ex.PW2/A         of      the       prosecutrix              was

           During her medical examination, the hymen of the

prosecutrix was found torn and rugged, per MLC Ex.PW12/A.

          Thus, all the public witnesses corroborate each other on

all material points.           It stands proved that the accused was

alone with the prosecutrix, in the said flat at 8 AM of

20-8-2011, when he caught hold of the prosecutrix ; took her

to master bed room and despite her resistance, raped her.

The prosecutrix was found hysterical and crying when PW11

Shri Yashwant Malhotra met her for the first time.

          Though the ld defence counsel tried to make a case of

consensual sex between the accused and prosecutrix but if

that was so, then why the prosecutrix locked herself in

another room immediately after the act ; why did she call

PW11 Shri Yashwant Malhotra at the spot and got the accused

arrested ; why the prosecutrix was found hysterical, crying

by PW11 Shri Yashwant Malhotra, when he first met her.

Hence, the contention that it was a consensual sex between

the two, do not appear to be convincing.

          Further, ld counsel for the accused argued that the FSL

report do not support the version of the prosecutrix as no

 semen could be detected on any of the exhibits, per FSL report

Ex.PW13/A. No doubt the semen could not detected by the

FSL, however, a bare perusal of the MLC Ex.PW12/D observes

that the prosecutrix had washed her genitals after the

incident. Further the medical evidence is only a corroborating

piece of evidence and the possibility of the accused removing

the stains from the bed sheet by cleaning them by water

cannot be ruled out, since he was present in the house even

after the act, whereas the prosecutrix had locked herself up in

another room. The photograph Ex-A-6, taken by crime team,

do show stains on bed sheet and it may have been cleaned

after the act.
          Hence, simply on the ground that FSL report do not show

semen stains on any of the clothes, the evidence of the

prosecutrix as of the other public witnesses who reached the

spot immediately just after the act and found her crying

hysterically can not be brushed aside. Thus, the contention

that the story is flimsy ; holds no ground and is rejected.

          Further, the contention that the prosecutrix did not raise

any hue or cry or that there is no evidence of any struggle do

 make her story unbelievable is also rejected.                                      Merely non

shouting or non raising of hue or cry, do not cast any doubt

upon the testimony of the prosecutrix when she categorically

had deposed that she was over-powered by the accused.

Even otherwise, this contention itself is misplaced as PW

Yashwant Malhotra had found the prosecutrix crying and

hysterical when he first met her.                       Even she had bolted the

door from inside and had only opened it when PW Yashwant

Malhotra had telephoned her.
          All these facts makes the version of the prosecutrix

trustworthy and believable and hence, to my mind, the

prosecution had proved its case beyond reasonable doubt and

hence, the accused is liable to be convicted for the offence

under          section         341   IPC   for     wrongfully              restraining                 the

prosecutrix and under section 376 IPC for committing rape

upon her. Thus, convicted.
Announced in the open
court today i.e. 21-1-2013.    ( Yogesh Khanna )
