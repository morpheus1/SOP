 (79)             In view of the above, I hereby hold that the medical evidence

characteristics   of   firing   pin   marks   and   breech   face   marks   present   on 

Ex.EC­1 and on test fired cartridge cases marked TC­1 and TC­2 were 

found identical when examined under the comparison microscope.  He has 
St. Vs. Inderpreet Singh Etc. FIR No. 63/12, PS Keshav Puram                  Page No. 68
 further proved that the deformed bullet (Ex.EB­1) was corresponding to 

the bullet of .32 inch cartridge but no opinion could be given on bullet 

(EB­1) whether it had been discharged through the revolver (Ex.F­1) or not 

as   the   individual   characteristics   of   rifling   marks   were   insufficient   for 

comparison.  The witness has also proved having opined that the revolver 

(Ex.F­1)  was   a   firearm,   the   cartridges   marked   Ex.A­1   to   Ex.A­12,

torn condition which jeans pant and underwear were having holes.  He has 

proved   having   examined   /   analyzed   the   swabs   for   gun   shot   residue 

particles but no opinion could be given due to insufficient data.  However, 

the holes on the jeans pant and the hole marked on the underwear have 

been caused by lead bullet discharged through a firearm.  He has proved 

his detailed report in this regard which is Ex.PW18/B.

serological report which is Ex.PW19/C.

microscopic and GCHS examination  Ex.1A  (stomach and intestine),  1B 

(liver,   spleen   and   kidney),  1C  (blood   sample)   and  1D  (blood   sample 

preserved in Sodium fluoride) were found to contain ethyl alcohol; Ex.

St. Vs. Inderpreet Singh Etc. FIR No. 63/12, PS Keshav Puram             Page No. 70
 (85)             In view of the above, I hereby hold that the forensic evidence 

is compatible to the prosecution case that before the incident the deceased 

Harvinder Singh had consumed alcohol but was still under control and 

after being hit with the bullet he was rushed to the hospital in the car 

bearing No. DL 3C AN 1539 from where the exhibits were lifted.   The 

forensic evidence is also compatible to the postmortem report with regard 

to the entry and exit points of the bullet (as reflected from the clothes 

which the deceased was wearing at the time of the incident).


Ocular Evidence / Allegations against the accused:

(86)             Ocular evidence/ eye witness count is the best evidence in any 

case.     The   case   of   the   prosecution   is   that   on   the   intervening   night   of 

14­15.3.2012   at   about   12:40 AM  DD  No.3 was  received at  Police Post 

Shanti Nagar from Kalra Hospital that an injured having gun shot injury 

had been admitted in the hospital on which SI Mukesh Kumar Incharge 

Police Post Shanti Nagar along with his staff reached Kalra Hospital, Kirti 

Nagar where they found the injured Harvinder Singh @ Happy admitted 

there with a history of having gun shot injuries but no eye witness was 

found.     They   then   collected   the   MLC   of   the   injured   on   which   it   was 

mentioned   that   the   injured   was   admitted   in  the   hospital   with  gun   shot 

injury   and   the   patient   was   declared   unfit   for   statement.   Thereafter   SI 

Mukesh Kumar  met Inderjeet Singh and Yashwant Singh in the  hospital 

itself   on   which   the  police  was  informed  by the  accused  that   Yashwant 


St. Vs. Inderpreet Singh Etc. FIR No. 63/12, PS Keshav Puram                        Page No. 71
 Singh had handed over his licensed revolver to Inderpreet Singh and that 

the said weapon had accidentally gone off and the bullet hit Harvinder 

Singh @ Happy Singh causing injuries to him on which he was rushed to 

the   hospital.     The   Investigating   Officer   then   made   inquires   from   both 

Gurpinder Singh and Yashwant Singh but there was no clarity with regard 

to   the   incident   which   had   taken   place   in   the   house   of   Amolak   the 

childhood friend of the deceased, on which SI Mukesh Kumar along with 

Gurpinder Singh, Inderpreet Singh and Yashwant Singh reached the house 

of Amolak who was the only eye witness to the incident and had disclosed 

that while Inderpreet Singh was fiddling with the revolver when it went off 

and  the  bullet hit Harvinder Singh.   Initially a case under Section 307 

Indian Penal Code was registered as Harvinder Singh @ Happy was still 

alive but after the death of Harvinder Singh it was converted into 302 

Indian Penal Code.  
(87)             The entire case revolves around the statement of Amolak the 

sole eye witness to the incident.  I may observe that Amolak (PW22) is the 

childhood   friend   of   the   deceased   and   on   the   date   of   the   incident   the 

deceased Harvinder Singh @ Happy decided to spent a night at the house 

of Amolak because the family of Amolak has gone to religious place at 

Amritsar and there was nobody in the house of Amolak.   The deceased 

Harvinder @ Happy was earlier known to Inderpreet Singh who had come 

to the same area where Amolak resides and while Inderpreet Singh was 

returning and had just crossed the house of Amolak, Harvinder Singh @ 


St. Vs. Inderpreet Singh Etc. FIR No. 63/12, PS Keshav Puram                      Page No. 72
 Happy saw him and called out to him after which Inderpreet Singh also 

joined them.  During this period Inderpreet Singh was fascinated with the 

gun / revolver which his Security Guard Yashwant Singh was carrying and 

took the said revolver from Yashwant Singh and showed the same to his 

friends.  Inderpreet Singh first removed the cartridges and thereafter they 

all friends i.e. Amolak, Harvinder Singh @ Happy and Inderpreet Singh 

got themselves photographed with the said revolver.  Thereafter, Inderpreet 

Singh again reloaded the revolver and during this process of loading the 

revolver with the cartridges he wanted to lock the same and while he was 

trying   to   do   so   it   went   off   thereby   hitting   Harvinder   @   Happy.     On 

noticing   this   Inderpreet   Singh   immediately   rushed   for   help   and   called 

Yashwant   Singh   inside   and   rushed   Harvinder   Singh   @   Happy   to   the 

hospital but unfortunately could not save him.  The relevant portion of the 

testimony of Amolak Singh (PW22) is as under:

                           On   14.03.2012   I   went   to   our   shop   at   about  

St. Vs. Inderpreet Singh Etc. FIR No. 63/12, PS Keshav Puram                       Page No. 73
                   10.00AM. At about 4.00 PM I received a telephone call  
                  from Harvinder @ Happy and he told me that he would  
                  reach at my house at about 8.00PM and then we would  
                  make further program for drinking and eating.   At bout  
                  8.30PM Harvinder @ Happy reached at my house.   We  
                  cooked   a   dry   chicken   for   our   dinner.     At   about  
                  9.00­9.15PM when we were taking dinner, Harvinder @  
                  Happy   received   a   mobile   call   from   his   friend   and   his  
                  friend   asked  about   his  whereabouts  then Harvinder  @  
                  Happy replied that he was present at my house.   After  
                  5­10   minutes   three   friends   of   Harvinder   @   Happy  
                  reached at my house and Harvinder opened the door.   I  
                  also reached near the door and we were talking to each  
                  other.  Meanwhile Harvinder @ Happy received a mobile  
                  call from his mother and his mother also asked about his  
                  whereabouts  and  he  replied  to  his  mother  that   he  was  
                  present at my house and thereafter mother of Harivinder  
                  also talked to me.  I told to the mother of Harvinder that  
                  we   had   taken   dinner   and   Harvinder   @   Happy   would  
                  sleep   at   my   house.    After   keeping   the   utensils   in   the  
                  kitchen   I   returned   back   at   the   door   and   found   that  
                  Inderpreet was crossing in front of door of my house.  
                  Harvinder   @   Happy   wished   to   Inderpreet   and   asked  
                  him   whether   he   recognized   him   or   not   and   then  
                  Inderpreet   told   that   he   recognized   him   very   well   his  
                  vehicle   was   parked   nearby   and   Inderpreet   hugged  
                  Harvinder   @   Happy.     Harvinder   @   Happy   asked  
                  Inderpreet to come inside the house to take dinner as we  
                  had cooked chicken.  The three friends of Harvinder who  
                  came earlier had gone away from there.  Inderpreet came  
                  inside of my house.  I served cooked chicken to Inderpreet  
                  who   asked   about   the   liquor   then   Harvinder   @   Happy  
                  replied   that   liquor   was   already   finished.     Thereafter

                   Inderpreet went outside the house for liquor and we also  
                  came out of the house and he took out one quarter bottle  
                  of liquor from his car and prepared two pegs for himself  
                  and   for   Harvinder   @   Happy.    Thereafter   we   again  
                  reached inside of our house and we were talking to each  
                  other.     Harinder   @   Happy   and   Inderpreet   were  
                  consuming liquor.  Inderpreet took out his revolver and  
                  told   that the cost of the revolver was about 2­1.5 lacs.  
                  He   took   out   the   cartridges   from   the   revolver   and  
                  simultaneously   he   was   cleaning   the   revolver.  
                  Harvinder   also   asked   Inderpreet   to   see   the   revolver.  
                  Harvinder also kept the same on his hand and told him  
                  that revolver was a heavy one.  Harvinder asked me take  
                  his photograph with the revolver for pasting the same on  
                  the   facebook   and   thereafter   I   took   one   or   two  
                  photographs of Harvinder with revolver by the mobile  
                  phone   of   Harvinder.     Thereafter   on   the   asking   of  
                  Harvinder   I   kept   the   revolver   on   my   hand   and  
                  Harvinder   @   Happy   took   my   photographs   with   the  
                  revolver.     Thereafter   I   handed   over   the   revolver   to  
                  Inderpreet.  Thereafter Inderpreet loaded the cartridges  
                  in the revolver and he was keeping the revolver under  
                  his   pant.     Thereafter   he   took   out   the   same   and   was  
                  saying that let the revolver be locked and he was in the  
                  process of locking the revolver but suddenly a loud noise  
                  came   out   from   the   revolver.   (thayen   ke   awaaz   hui).  
                  Harvinder   told   that   "use   lag   gai   yaar"     Meanwhile  
                  Inderpreet started checking the body of Harvinder on  
                  his   clothes   parts   and   thereafter   ran   away   from   my  
                  house.     I   asked   Harvinder   @   Happy   as   to   where   he  
                  received the bullet injury and after two­three steps he  
                  was falling on the ground.  Meanwhile Inderpreet again

                   came   inside   the   room   with   an   old   age   person   and  
                  thereafter  we all took Harvinder @ Happy to the car  
                  and I asked Inderpreet that I was coming after closing  
                  the door of my house but Inderpreet went away with that  
                  old age person and injured Harvinder @ Happy with his  
                  car from there.  Thereafter I informed all the facts to my  
                  neighbour namely Pammi Aunty and asked her to make  
                  call to Inderpreet @ Mannu but there was no response  
                  from  the   side of  Inderpreet  @  Mannu  and  thereafter I  
                  returned   back   to   my   house.     After   one   and   half   hour  
                  Pammi Aunty informed me that Harvinder @ Happy was  
                  admitted in the hospital and he was O.K.  After one and  
                  half hour I received a phone call from my father and I  
                  told all the facts to him.  After one and half hour police  
                  came  at   my  house and they asked me about  the bullet  
                  firing.  I told all the facts to them.  I had also shown them  
                  the   place   of   incident.     Police   also   seized   one   blood  
                  stained bed sheet on the spot on which we were sitting  
                  and police kept the same in a polythene and sealed the

(88)             Amolak   has   been   subjected   to   sustained   cross­examination 

wherein he has admitted that on the date of incident the accused Inderpreet 


St. Vs. Inderpreet Singh Etc. FIR No. 63/12, PS Keshav Puram                        Page No. 76
 Singh was going away in the street and had in fact crossed his house when 

the deceased Harvinder @ Happy called out him from behind his name. 

He has also admitted that Inderpreet Singh was going somewhere when 

Harvinder @ Happy invited him.  When asked about the actual incident of 

firing he has stated that initially they did not realize that Harvinder @ 

Happy had been hit by bullet and has explained that it was only when he 

remarked "lag gayee yaar" then they realized that he had been shot on 

which Inderpreet Singh immediately checked Harvinder as to where he 

had been shot but could not find any wound.   He has further stated that 

before Inderpreet had come to his house they i.e. himself and Harvinder 

already had a drinking session and had taken about three pegs each. 

(89)             The   accused   Yashwant   Singh   is   the   Security   Guard   of   the 

accused   Inderpreet   Singh   and   had   accompanied   him   to   the   place   of 

incident but was standing outside along with the driver Gurpinder Singh in 

the car when the incident took place.  Gurpinder Singh (PW23) had been 

employed as Driver to Inderpreet Singh about one and a half years prior to 

the   incident   and   on   the   date   of   the   incident   was   with   him.     He   has 

corroborated   the   testimony   of   Amolak   and   his   testimony   is   also 

compatible to the prosecution case that while Inderpreet Singh went inside 

the house he (Gurpinder) along with Yashwant Singh remained outside in 

the car.  The relevant portion of the testimony of Gurpinder Singh (PW23) 

is as under:

                   "......... I was employed as a driver to Inderpreet Singh  
                  resident of B­2, Model Town II, Delhi for about 1 ½ years  
                  prior   to   the   incident.     Indepreet   Singh   used   to   reside  
                  alone on the first floor along with his servant and the  
                  chachi of Inderpreet Singh resides on the second floor.  
                  Inderpeet   Singh   also   maintained   security   guards   with  
                  him.  On 14.03.2012 Yashwant Singh had been appointed  
                  as his security guard in the evening at around 6 PM.  On  
                  that day at around 7 PM Inderpreet Singh told me that he  
                  wanted to visit his mama at Tri Nagar and I took him to  
                  Tri Nagar in Fort Fiesta bearing No. 1539.  First we went  
                  to Ashok Vihar where we had chicken.   When we were  
                  having chicken while sitting in the car itself, Inderpreet  
                  Singh asked Yashwant body guard to show his revolver  
                  and thereafter taking the revolver from Yashwant he put  
                  his  in  the  dub of his pant.   Thereafter we went  to Tri  
                  Nagar to visit the mamaji of Inderpreet Singh.  At around  
                  9­9:30 PM while we were coming out from the house of  
                  Mamaji of Inderpreet Singh when suddenly we heard the  
                  voice of Happy Singh who was in the house of Amolak  
                  which is one house away from the house of the mama of  
                  Inderpreet   Singh.   I  kept  sitting in the car along with  
                  Yashwant Singh which was parked in the gali opposite  
                  the  shop  of pakore wala while I saw Inderpreet Singh  
                  entering the house of Amolak.  I was to go home early on  
                  that   day   and   hence   I   had   informed   Inderpreet   Singh  
                  about the same when he was still at his mama's house.  
                  At around 9:30 PM three persons i.e. Inderpreet Singh,  
                  Amolak and Happy Singh came near the car and picked  
                  up the whiskey bottle kept in the vehicle and went back in  
                  the house of Amolak while I and Yashwant remained in  
                  the   car.    At   around   11   PM   Inderpreet   Singh   came  
                  running   to   the   car   and   handed   over   the   revolver   to  
                  Yashwant   Singh   telling   him   "mujhse   goli   chal   gaye

                   hai".  When Inderpreet Singh went back to the house of  
                  Amolak  after handing over the fire arm  to Yashwant  
                  Singh,   I   saw   Yashwant   Singh   following   Inderpreet  
                  Singh to the house of Amolak. Soon thereafter I saw  
                  Amolak,   Yashwant   Singh   and   Inderpreet   Singh  
                  carrying Happy Singh to the vehicle while Amolak went  
                  back   to   his   house,   Inderpreet   Singh   told   me   to   rush  
                  Happy Singh to the hospital as he was still breathing at  
                  that time.  I tried to make inquiries from the persons of  
                  the road if there were any doctor or dispensary nearby  
                  but there was no help.   I told Inderpreet Singh that I  
                  knew where Kheterpal hospital was and hence we i.e. I,  
                  Inderpreet   Singh   and   Yashwant   Singh   immediately  
                  rushed Happy Singh to Kheterpal Hospital.   There at  
                  Kheterpal Hospital, the doctor on duty informed us that  
                  Happy   Singh   required   immediate   specialized   attention  
                  and they were not having Oxygen at that time and hence  
                  we   should   rush   him   to   near   by   Kalra   Hospital.     We 
                  requested the doctors to arrange for an ambulance but  
                  we were told that since that would take time, hence we  
                  should   immediately   rush   him   in   our   own   car   and  
                  therefore we then put Happy Singh in the car and rushed  
                  him to Kalra Hospital.   At that time Happy Singh was  
                  still breathing when Inderpreet Singh got him admitted  
                  and   the  doctors  rushed   him   to   ICU   and   admitted   him  
                  there.  I remained outside in the hospital and do not know  
                  what   proceedings   were   being   done.     Police   had   also  
                  come to the hospital.  In the morning at 6 AM we i.e. I,  
                  Inderpreet Singh, Yashwant Singh and police went to the  
                  house of Amolak where I was also interrogated and my  
                  statement was recorded.  My statement was also recorded  
                  by   the   Ld.   MM   on   the   next   day.     I   can   identify   the  
                  accused.   At this stage, witness has correctly identified  

St. Vs. Inderpreet Singh Etc. FIR No. 63/12, PS Keshav Puram                           Page No. 79
                   both   the   accused   persons   i.e.   Inderpreet   Singh   and  
                  Yashwant Singh who are present in the court today...." 

(90)             The   witness   Gurpinder   Singh   has   explained   that   previously 

Inderpreet Singh was having two body guards.  He has admitted that it was 

on the insistence of Inderpreet Singh that Yashwant Singh had given his 

revolver   to   Inderpreet   Singh   when   they   were   having   chicken   at   Ashok 

Vihar.  He has further stated that Harvinder Singh was conscious and was 

crying in pain while Yashwant Singh was holding him.  He has explained 

that he had asked Yashwant if Harvinder was alright on which Yashwant 

told   him   that   he   was   still   conscious   and   they   should   rush   him   to   the 

hospital.  He has further proved that Yashwant Singh was throughout with 

him at the time when Inderpreet Singh went inside the house of Amolak 

and also thereafter when they went to the hospital.  

(91)             The father of the deceased Harvinder Singh namely Ajit Singh 

(PW13) and his brother in law namely Sarabhjeet Singh (PW14) have for 

the first time came up with a new story that the deceased Harvinder @ 

Happy was having some money dealings with Inderpreet Singh on account 

of which there was a  Kaha­Suni  and Harvinder was very tense on this 

account which fact he had even disclosed to this father Ajit Singh and Ajit 

Singh had shared this fact with Sarabhjeet Singh.   Both Ajit Singh and 

Sarabhjeet Singh have corroborated the testimony of Amolak who was the 

childhood friend of Harvinder and on the date of incident Harvinder was 

to spent the night with Amolak as his family had gone out of Delhi.  I may 


St. Vs. Inderpreet Singh Etc. FIR No. 63/12, PS Keshav Puram                       Page No. 80
 mention that it is for the first time that the allegation of there being a prior 

money transaction between the deceased and the accused Inderpreet Singh 

has been brought to forth.  No where in their statements made to the police 

have the father of the deceased or his brother in law disclosed this fact to 

them nor any evidence has been brought on record in this regard.  Amolak 

the childhood friend of the deceased has conceded that he is not aware of 

any such transaction.  This being the background the improvements in the 

testimonies of Ajit Singh and Sarabhjeet Singh is liable to be ignored.

(92)             Also, when the incriminating material was put to the accused 

Inderpreet   he has not denied the incident.   Rather, he has admitted the 

same and also the fact that it was he, himself who rushed the deceased to 

the hospital in order to save his life.   The relevant questions put to him 

along with his response is reproduced as under:

                  on the ground and meanwhile you accused Inderpreet again  
                  came inside the room with your co­accused Yashwant Singh  
                  and took the Harvinder @ Happy to the car and he (Amolak)  
                  asked you accused Inderpreet that he was coming after the  
                  closing of door but you accused Inderpreet went away with  
                  your co­accused Yashwant and injured Harvinder @ Happy  
                  with car from there. What you have to say about it?
                  Ans. : It is correct. 

(93)             In view of the above, I hereby hold that not only the presence 

of the accused Inderpreet Singh & Yashwant Singh outside the house of 

Amolak   stands   established   and   proved   but   also   the   fact   that   the   firing 

incident did take place and the revolver from which the bullet had been 

fired and  which hit the deceased Harvinder Singh belonged to accused 

Yashwant Singh license of which has been duly proved by PW21 Tariq

          Singh to the house of Amolak where they had cooked their meals

         gone to Golden Temple at Amritsar.
    ➢ That Amolak and Harvinder Singh @ Happy already had three pegs

    ➢ That   when   Inderpreet   Singh   joined   Amolak   and   Harvinder   @

         car and procured the alcohol kept in the car after which he returned 

         to the house of Amolak.
    ➢ That Inderpreet Singh who at that time was carrying the licensed 

         revolver of Yashwant Singh and had not returned the same to him, 

         took out the same and showed it to Harvinder Singh @ Happy Singh 

         and told that it was valuing around Rs. 1.5 to 2 Lacs in the market.

St. Vs. Inderpreet Singh Etc. FIR No. 63/12, PS Keshav Puram                    Page No. 85
          to Inderpreet Singh.
    ➢ That Inderpreet Singh again loaded the cartridges in the revolver 

         and kept the same in the pocket of his pant.
    ➢ That   soon   thereafter   Inderpreet   Singh   realized   that   he   had   not 

         locked   the   revolver  and  hence   he  took  out   the  revolver  from  his 

         pocket  and attempted to lock the same during which process the 

         revolver went off and the bullets hit Harvinder @ Happy.

    ➢ That initially Amolak and Inderpreet Singh did not realize what had 

         happened  until  Harvinder Singh @ Happy told them  that he had 

         been hit  (lag gayi yaar).
    ➢ That   on   hearing   this   Inderpreet   Singh   tried   to   examine   where 

         Harvinder Singh @ Happy was hit but could not find the wound and 

         hence   immediately  rushed  out  of  the  house  and handed over the 

         revolver to Yashwant Singh and told that there was an accidental 

         firing (mujhse goli chal gaye hai).
    ➢ That the accused Yashwant Singh followed Inderpreet Singh inside 

         the house of Amolak and picked up Harvinder Singh @ Happy and 

         carried   him   to   their   car   (testimony   of   Amolak   in   this   regard   is 

         corroborated by the testimony of driver Gurpinder Singh and both 

         the accused admit the same).
    ➢ That  thereafter  Inderpreet Singh along with his driver Gurpinder 

         Singh   immediately   rushed   to   the   nearest   hospital   while   Yaswant 

         Singh held on to the injured.

St. Vs. Inderpreet Singh Etc. FIR No. 63/12, PS Keshav Puram                       Page No. 86
     ➢ That first they went to Kheterpal Nursing Home where the Oxygen 

         Machine was not working and hence they took the injured to Kalra 

         Hospital during which period the injured Harvinder Singh @ Happy 

         was breathing and conscious but crying in pain.
    ➢ That at about 12:10 AM (midnight) Harvinder was admitted to Kalra 

         Hospital and provided medical treatment and doctors also informed 

         the police.
    ➢ That when the local police reached the hospital they met the accused 

         Inderpreet   Singh   and   Yashwant   Singh   who   informed   them   about 

         what had happened in the house of Amolak and also co­operated in 

         the investigations.
    ➢ That   at   about   2:30   AM   the   injured   Harvinder   Singh   @   Happy 

         expired on account of the said gun shot injuries.
    ➢ That the accused Yashwant Singh himself handed over his revolver 

         along with the cartridges to the police in the hospital itself after 

         which both Inderpreet and Yashwant were arrested.


(94)            he charges framed against the accused Inderpreet Singh is for 

the offence under Section 302 Indian Penal Code and 25/27 of Arms Act 

whereas against the Yashwant Singh for the offence under Section 30 of 

Arms Act.   In so far as the accused Yashwant Singh is concerned the 

Arms Clerk Tariq Ahmad Sheikh (PW21) has proved the entries pertaining 

to Arms License bearing No. S/1088­B/Arms/DMS/09 dated 7.10.2009 of 


St. Vs. Inderpreet Singh Etc. FIR No. 63/12, PS Keshav Puram               Page No. 87
 S/DBBL 12 Bore Gun along with 50 /100 cartridges in favour of accused 

Yashwant   Singh  which   is  Ex.PW21/A  and  its   renewal  record  which  is 

Ex.PW21/B showing that the license had been given on Keep and Carry 

basis.   He   has   also   proved   that  additional   permission   was   granted   to 

Yashwant Singh to purchase NP Bore Revolver / Pistol along with 50 /100 

cartridges (Yashwant  Singh being in Army at that  time).   The accused 

Yashwant Singh is an ex­service man and on the date of incident was his 

first day in the employment of Inderpreet Singh when he was compelled 

by Inderpreet Singh to handover his revolver to him, which is a clear cut 

violation of the conditions of license and makes the accused Yashwant 

Singh liable for the offence punishable under Section 30 of Arms Act.

(95)             Coming now to the charge under  Section 302 Indian Penal 

Code settled against the accused Inderpreet Singh, as per the provisions of 

Section 299 Indian Penal Code who ever causes death by doing an act with 

the intention of causing death, or with the intention of causing such bodily 

injury as is likely to cause death, or with the knowledge that he is likely by 

such act to cause death, commits the offence of culpable homicide.

(96)             Further,   as   per   the   provisions   of  Section   300  Indian   Penal 

Code culpable homicide is murder, if the act by which the death is caused 

is   done   with   the   intention   of   causing   death,   or   if   it   is   done   with   the 

intention of causing such bodily injury as the offender knows to be likely 

to cause the death of the person to whom the harm is caused, or if it is 


St. Vs. Inderpreet Singh Etc. FIR No. 63/12, PS Keshav Puram                           Page No. 88
 done with the intention of causing bodily injury to any person and the 

bodily injury intended to be inflicted is sufficient in the ordinary course of 

nature to cause death, or If the person committing the act knows that it is 

so imminently dangerous that it must, in all probability, cause death or 

such   bodily   injury   as   is   likely   to   cause   death,   and   commits   such   act 

without any excuse for incurring the risk of causing death or such injury as 

aforesaid and this is punishable under Section 302 Indian Penal Code.

(97)             There   are   five   exceptions   provided   to   the   above.    Firstly 

culpable homicide is not murder  if the offender, whilst deprived of the 

power of self­control by grave and sudden provocation, causes the death of 

the   person   who   gave  the  provocation  or   causes  the   death  of   any  other 

person by mistake or accident.   I may observe that this exception is also 

subject to the proviso that the provocation is not sought or voluntarily pro­

voked by the offender as an excuse for killing or doing harm to any person; 

the provocation is not given by anything done in obedience to the law, or 

by a public servant in the lawful exercise of the powers of such public 

servant;   the   provocation   is   not   given   by   anything   done   in   the   lawful 

exercise of the right of private defence; the provocation was grave and 

sudden   enough   to   prevent   the   offence   from   amounting   to   murder   is   a 

question   of   fact.    Secondly  Culpable   homicide   is   not   murder   if   the 

offender, in the exercise in good faith of the right of private defence of 

person or property, exceeds the power given to him by law and causes the 

death of the person against whom he is exercising such right of defence 

St. Vs. Inderpreet Singh Etc. FIR No. 63/12, PS Keshav Puram                      Page No. 89
 without premeditation, and without any intention of doing more harm than 

is necessary for the purpose of such defence.  Thirdly Culpable homicide 

is not murder if the offender, being a public servant or aiding a public 

servant acting for the advancement of public justice, exceeds the powers 

given to him by law, and causes death by doing an act which he, in good 

faith, believes to be lawful and necessary for the due discharge of his duty 

as such public servant and without ill­will towards the person whose death 

is caused.   Fourthly  Culpable homicide is not murder if it is committed 

without   premeditation   in  a   sudden  fight   in  the  heat  of   passion  upon  a 

sudden quarrel and without the offender having taken undue advantage or 

acted in a cruel or unusual manner and it is immaterial in such cases which 

party offers the provocation or commits the first assault.  Lastly Culpable 

homicide is not murder when the person whose death is caused, being 

above the age of eighteen years, suffers death or takes the risk of death 

with his own consent.  (Ref.: Daya Nand Vs. State of Haryana reported in 

AIR 2008 SC 1823).
(98)             Whenever a court is confronted with the question whether the 

offence is 'murder' or 'culpable homicide not amounting to murder' on the 

facts of a case, it will be convenient for it to approach the problem in three 

stages. The question to be considered at the first stage would be, whether 

the accused has done an act by doing which he has caused the death of 

another. Proof of such causal connection between the act of the accused 

and the death, leads to the second stage for considering whether that act of 

St. Vs. Inderpreet Singh Etc. FIR No. 63/12, PS Keshav Puram                Page No. 90
 the accused amounts to "culpable homicide" as defined in Section 299. If 

the answer to this question is prima facie found in the affirmative, the 

stage for considering the operation of Section 300, Penal Code, is reached. 

This is the stage at which the Court should determine whether the facts 

proved by the prosecution bring the case within the ambit of any of the 

four Clauses of the definition of 'murder' contained in Section 300. If the 

answer to this question is in the negative the offence would be 'culpable 

homicide   not   amounting   to   murder',   punishable   under   the   first   or   the 

second   part   of   Section   304,   depending,   respectively,   on   whether   the 

second or the third Clause of Section 299 is applicable. If this question is 

found in the positive, but the case comes within any of the Exceptions 

enumerated is Section 300, the offence would still be 'culpable homicide 

not amounting to murder', punishable under the First Part of Section 304, 

Indian Penal Code.  Note: All murders are culpable homicide but not vice­

a­versa.  (Ref.: State of A.P. Vs. Rayavarapu Punnayya reported in AIR  

1977 SC 45).
(99)              Applying   the   settled   principles   of   law   to   the   facts   of   the 

present case it is writ large from the evidence which has come on record 

and   also   from   his   subsequent   conduct   of   the   accused   that   there   is   no 

history   of   animosity   between   the   deceased   and   the   accused   Inderpreet 

Singh.  Rather, they were good friends and even on the date of incident the 

accused Inderpreet Singh was not even aware of the presence of Harvinder 

Singh @ Happy at the house of Amolak which is adjoining the house of 

St. Vs. Inderpreet Singh Etc. FIR No. 63/12, PS Keshav Puram                         Page No. 91
 his maternal uncle / mama.  It stands established that Inderpreet Singh had 

already crossed the house of Amolak when Harvinder Singh @ Happy 

called   out   him   and   invited   him   for   a   drinking   session   at   the   house   of 

Amolak.     It   is   also   established   that   Harvinder   @   Happy,   Amolak   & 

Inderpreet Singh are young boys in their early twenties and were having a 

good time having cooked dinner for themselves and a drinking session. 

The revolver was initially unloaded by Inderpreet Singh after which they 

all   took   turns   in   posing   with  the  same  and taking  photographs  with  it 

reflecting how these young boys were fascinated by this weapon.   It was 

only thereafter when Inderpreet Singh reloaded the revolver and kept the 

same in his pocket and then suddenly remembered that he had forgotten to 

lock the same, that while trying to lock the same that it accidentally went 

off.  The nature of injuries reflected in the MLC and Postmortem report of 

Harvinder Singh @ Happy particularly the entry and exit wounds indicates 

that at the relevant time Harvinder Singh was in a sitting position.

(100)             Inderpreet Singh is a young boy not a professional in handling 

the firearms.   At the time of the incident Inderpreet Singh was with his 

friends and was boastfully exhibiting the revolver to his friends after which 

all these young boys took turns in getting themselves photographed.  From 

his side he had initially taken all necessary precautions when he removed 

the cartridges from the revolver and after the photography session he again 

loaded the same and kept it in his pocket when he suddenly realized that it 

was not locked and while locking the same the revolver accidentally went 


St. Vs. Inderpreet Singh Etc. FIR No. 63/12, PS Keshav Puram                        Page No. 92
 off.  He had taken the precautions of removing the cartridges from the 

revolver and after reloading the same he wanted to lock the same and it 

is this which establishes that the accused Inderpreet Singh never intended 

to do any harm to anyone and could not have foreseen the danger in trying 

the lock the revolver after loading the cartridges in the same while sitting 

in the room.  The death of Harvinder Singh @ Happy was caused due to 

inadvertent triggering of the revolver while Inderpreet Singh was trying to 

lock   the   same   when   it   accidentally   went   off   which   is   a   result   of 

misadventure and misfortune.  
(101)             Ld. Defence counsel has vehemently argued that the present 

case   falls   with   the   purview   of   Section   80   of   Indian   Penal   code   as   no 

offence has been committed by the accused but I do not find any merit in 

the  said  argument  because it is writ  large that  the revolver in question 

belonged to Yashwant Singh and Inderpreet Singh had no knowledge of 

operating the same and was incompetent to handle the revolver.   In the 

background when he was trying to showoff the said revolver and while re­

loading   the   same   it   accidentally   went   off   which   is   an   act   of   gross 

negligence covered under the provisions of Section 304­A Indian Penal 

Code.     The   accused   Inderpreet   Singh   was   fiddling   with   a   dangerous 

weapon and he did not know how to operate its safety device.  He started 

fiddling   with   the   same   regardless   of   the   personal   safety   of   the   others 

around him and failed to exercise due care and caution which a reasonable 

person could have taken and conducted rashly and negligently within the 

St. Vs. Inderpreet Singh Etc. FIR No. 63/12, PS Keshav Puram                       Page No. 93
 meaning   of   Section   304­A   of   Indian   Penal   Code.     In   so   far   as   the 

provisions of Section 302 Indian Penal Code are concerned I hereby hold 

that   the   prosecution   has   not   been   able   to   prove   and   substantiate   the 

intention and knowledge so attributed to the accused Inderpreet Singh to 

cause   death   of   the   deceased   and   in   this   regard   I   am   supported   by  the 

judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of  Kana Ram Vs,  

State of Rajasthan reported in 1987 ACJ 1768 and also in the case of Ram  

Dass Vs. State reported in MANU/UP/0415/1967.  I may further note that 

even after the incident both Inderpreet Singh and Yashwant Singh wasted 

no time in rushing Harvinder to the hospital and did their best to save his 

life.     Rather,   on   the   other   hand   it   is   Amolak  whose   conduct   is   highly 

improper.  The incident had taken place in his house.  He never bothered to 

either   accompany   the   injured   his   childhood   friend   to   the   hospital   nor 

informed his family or even the police of the same.  Rather, on the other 

hand the subsequent conduct of Inderpreet leaves no doubt that not only 

did he try his best to save the life of the victim Harvinder but also made no 

attempts to run away or shift the liability on anybody else which he could 

conveniently   do.     This   being   the   background,   I   hereby   hold   that   the 

prosecution   has   miserably   failed   to   prove   the   necessary   intent   and 

knowledge so attributed to the accused Inderpreet Singh who is hereby 

held guilty of gross negligence punishable under  Section 304­A Indian 

Penal Code (not under Section 302 Indian Penal Code).



St. Vs. Inderpreet Singh Etc. FIR No. 63/12, PS Keshav Puram                      Page No. 94
 (102)              Further, it has been proved that after the registration of the 

case and during investigations the sanction under Section 39 of Arms Act 

to prosecute the accused Inderpreet Singh for offence under Section 25 of 

Arms Act had been accorded by the DCP Sh. S. Saravanan (PW16) which 

sanction   is  Ex.PW16/A.     The  license  holder   of  the   firearm   is  accused 

Yashwant Singh and the act of the accused Inderpreet Singh in retaining 

unauthorized possession of NP Bore Revolver / Pistol of .32 (7.65 MM) is 

illegal which is the same firearm which was negligently and casually used 

by him. I hereby hold the accused Inderpreet Singh guilty of the offence 

under Section 25/27 of Arms Act.


FINAL CONCLUSIONS:
(103)              In   the   case   of  Sharad   Birdhichand   Sarda   ­vs­   State   of  

Maharastra,  reported   in  AIR   1984   SC   1622,  the   Apex   Court   has   laid 

down   the   tests   which   are   pre­requisites   before   conviction   should   be 

recorded, which are as under:
St. Vs. Inderpreet Singh Etc. FIR No. 63/12, PS Keshav Puram                          Page No. 95
                    3. The circumstances should be of conclusive nature  
                      and tendency;
                   4. They   should   exclude   every   possible   hypothesis  
                      except the one to be proved; and 
                   5. There must be a chain of evidence so complete as  
                      not   to   leave   any   reasonable   ground   for   the  
                      conclusion   consistent   with   the   innocence   of   the  
                      accused   and   must   show   that   in   all   human  
                      probability the act  must have been done by the  
                      accused.
(104)              Applying the above principles of law to the present case it is 

evident that the investigation conducted including the documents prepared 

in the present case have been substantially proved by the police witnesses 

including the first and the second investigating officers.  On the basis of 

the   testimonies   of   the   various   witnesses,   the   following   facts   stand 

established:


    ➢ That on 14.3.2012 at about 6:00 PM Inderpreet Singh told his driver 

         Gurpinder   Singh   that   he   would   be   going   to   meet   his   Mama   / 

         Maternal Uncle at Tri Nagar on which he took his driver Gurpinder 

St. Vs. Inderpreet Singh Etc. FIR No. 63/12, PS Keshav Puram                       Page No. 96
          Singh and body guard Yashwant Singh with him and went to Tri 

         Nagar in Ford Fiesta car bearing No. DL 3C AN 1539.
    ➢ That   on   the   way   to  Tri   Nagar   they   had   chicken   at   Ashok   Vihar 

         where on the insistence of Inderpreet Singh as he wanted to have the 

         revolver,   the   accused   Yashwant   Singh   handed   over   his   licensed 

         revolver to Inderpreet Singh.
    ➢ That Amolak Singh is residing at House No. 2079/164 Ganesh Pura, 

         Tri   Nagar   and   his   parents   had   gone   out   of   Delhi   on   which   his 

         childhood friend Harvinder Singh @ Happy Singh had offered to 

         stay with him overnight at his house on the night of 14­15.3.2012.

    ➢ That Inderpreet Singh after visiting his Mama was going back home 

         and he passed in front of house of Amolak bearing No. 2079/164 

         Ganesh   Pura,   Tri   Nagar   where   Harvinder   Singh   @   Happy   was 

         visiting Amolak.
    ➢  That Harvinder Singh @ Happy was known to Inderpreet Singh and 

         when   he   saw   him   passing   through   the   house,   he   called   out   to 

         Inderpreet   Singh   from   behind   after   which   he   invited   Inderpreet 

         Singh to the house of Amolak where they had cooked their meals 

         and offered the same to him for dinner.
    ➢ That Harvinder Singh @ Happy had come to the house of Amolak 

         for eating and drinking together because the parents of Amolak had 

         gone to Golden Temple at Amritsar.



St. Vs. Inderpreet Singh Etc. FIR No. 63/12, PS Keshav Puram                       Page No. 97
     ➢ That Amolak and Harvinder Singh @ Happy already had three pegs 

         of alcohol before Inderpreet Singh had joined them.

    ➢ That   when   Inderpreet   Singh   joined   Amolak   and   Harvinder   @ 

         Happy, he asked for alcohol on which Harvinder @ Happy told him 

         that there was no alcohol on which Inderpreet Singh went out to his 

         car and procured the alcohol kept in the car after which he returned 

         to the house of Amolak.
    ➢ That Inderpreet Singh who at that time was carrying the licensed 

         revolver of Yashwant Singh and had not returned the same to him, 

         took out the same and showed it to Harvinder Singh @ Happy Singh 

         and told that it was valuing around Rs. 1.5 to 2 Lacs in the market.

    ➢ That Inderpreet Singh removed the cartridges from the revolver and 

         handed it over to Harvinder Singh @ Happy and Amolak.

    ➢ That both Harvinder Singh @ Happy and Amolak were fascinated 

         by the firearm and wanted to get themselves snapped / photographed 

         with   the   same   after   which   all   the   boys   i.e.   Inderpreet   Singh, 

         Harvinder @ Happy and Amolak posed themselves with the firearm 

         and took photographs of each other and thereafter returned the same 

         to Inderpreet Singh.
    ➢ That Inderpreet Singh again loaded the cartridges in the revolver 

         and kept the same in the pocket of his pant.
    ➢ That   soon   thereafter   Inderpreet   Singh   realized   that   he   had   not 

         locked   the   revolver  and  hence   he  took  out   the  revolver  from  his 


St. Vs. Inderpreet Singh Etc. FIR No. 63/12, PS Keshav Puram                    Page No. 98
          pocket  and attempted to lock the same during which process the 

         revolver went off and the bullets hit Harvinder @ Happy.

    ➢ That initially Amolak and Inderpreet Singh did not realize what had 

         happened  until Harvinder Singh @ Happy told them that  he had 

         been hit  (lag gayi yaar).
    ➢ That   on   hearing   this   Inderpreet   Singh   tried   to   examine   where 

         Harvinder Singh @ Happy was hit but could not find the wound and 

         hence   immediately  rushed  out  of  the  house  and handed over the 

         revolver to Yashwant Singh and told that there was an accidental 

         firing (mujhse goli chal gaye hai).
    ➢ That the accused Yashwant Singh followed Inderpreet Singh inside 

         the house of Amolak and picked up Harvinder Singh @ Happy and 

         carried   him   to   their   car   (testimony   of   Amolak   in   this   regard   is 

         corroborated by the testimony of driver Gurpinder Singh and both 

         the accused admit the same).
    ➢ That  thereafter  Inderpreet Singh along with his driver Gurpinder 

         Singh   immediately   rushed   to   the   nearest   hospital   while   Yaswant 

         Singh held on to the injured.
    ➢ That first they went to Kheterpal Nursing Home where the Oxygen 

         Machine was not working and hence they took the injured to Kalra 

         Hospital during which period the injured Harvinder Singh @ Happy 

         was breathing and conscious but crying in pain.



St. Vs. Inderpreet Singh Etc. FIR No. 63/12, PS Keshav Puram                       Page No. 99
     ➢ That at about 12:10 AM (midnight) Harvinder was admitted to Kalra 

         Hospital and provided medical treatment and doctors also informed 

         the police.
    ➢ That when the local police reached the hospital they met the accused 

         Inderpreet   Singh   and   Yashwant   Singh   who   informed   them   about 

         what had happened in the house of Amolak and also co­operated in 

         the investigations.
    ➢ That   at   about   2:30   AM   the   injured   Harvinder   Singh   @   Happy 

         expired on account of the said gun shot injuries.
    ➢ That the accused Yashwant Singh himself handed over his revolver 

         along with the cartridges to the police in the hospital itself after 

         which both Inderpreet and Yashwant were arrested.


(105)              The   medical   evidence   on   record   is   compatible   to   the 

prosecution case that the deceased Harvinder Singh @ Happy Singh had 

received a gun shot injury and  his death was due to shock consequent 

upon excessive blood loss due to fire arm injury which injuries were 

sufficient to cause death in ordinary course of nature.   Further, the 

forensic   evidence   is   compatible  to the   prosecution  case  that   before  the 

incident the deceased Harvinder Singh had consumed alcohol but was still 

under   control   and   after   being  hit  with  the  bullet  he  was  rushed  to  the 

hospital in the car bearing No. DL 3C AN 1539 from where the exhibits 

were lifted.   The forensic evidence is also compatible to the postmortem 


St. Vs. Inderpreet Singh Etc. FIR No. 63/12, PS Keshav Puram                Page No. 100
 report with regard to the entry and exit points of the bullet (as reflected 

from   the   clothes   which   the   deceased   was   wearing   at   the   time   of   the 

incident).
(106)              There are two stages in the criminal prosecution.   The first 

obviously   is   the   commission   of   the   crime   and   the   second   is   the 

investigation conducted regarding the same.   In case the investigation is 

faulty or has not been proved in evidence at trial, the question which arise 

is whether it would absolve the liability of the culprit who has committed 

the offence? The answer is obviously in negative, since any lapse on the 

part of the investigation does not negate the offence.  

(107)              The prosecution has proved the identity of the accused, the 

manner in which the offence has been committed, place of commission of 

the   offence,   the   investigation   including   the   documents   prepared, 

postmortem report, etc.  There is nothing which could shatter the veracity 

of the prosecution witnesses or falsify the claim of the prosecution. All the 

prosecution witnesses have materially supported the prosecution case and 

the   testimonies   of   the   prosecution   witnesses   do   not   suffer   from   any 

infirmity,   inconsistency   or   contradiction   and   are   consistent   and 

corroborative.   The evidence of the prosecution witnesses is natural and 

trustworthy and corroborated by medical evidence and the witness of the 

prosecution have been able to built up a continuous link.  

(108)             However, it is evident that after the incident both Inderpreet 

Singh and Yashwant Singh wasted no time in rushing Harvinder to the 


St. Vs. Inderpreet Singh Etc. FIR No. 63/12, PS Keshav Puram                   Page No. 101
 hospital and did their best to save his life.  Rather, on the other hand it is 

Amolak whose conduct is highly improper.  The incident had taken place 

in   his   house.     He   never   bothered   to   either   accompany   the   injured   his 

childhood friend to the hospital nor informed his family or even the police 

of   the   same.     Rather,   on   the   other   hand   the   subsequent   conduct   of 

Inderpreet leaves no doubt that not only did he try his best to save the life 

of the victim Harvinder but also made no attempts to run away or shift the 

liability on anybody else which he could conveniently do.  This being the 

background,   I   hereby   hold  that   the  prosecution  has   miserably  failed  to 

prove   the   necessary   intent   and   knowledge   so   attributed   to   the   accused 

Inderpreet Singh who is hereby held guilty of gross negligence punishable 

under Section 304­A Indian Penal Code (not under Section 302 Indian 

Penal Code).
(109)              Further,   it   has   been   proved   that   the   license   holder   of   the 

firearm is accused Yashwant Singh and the act of the accused Inderpreet 

Singh in retaining unauthorized possession of NP Bore Revolver / Pistol of 

.32 (7.65 MM) is illegal which is the same firearm which was negligently 

and casually used by him.  Therefore I hereby hold the accused Inderpreet 

Singh guilty of the offence under Section 25&27 of Arms Act.

(110)              In so far as the accused Yashwant Singh is concerned, he is an 

ex­service   man   and   on   the   date   of   incident   was   his   first   day   in   the 

employment of Inderpreet Singh when he was compelled by Inderpreet 

Singh to handover his revolver to him, which is a clear cut violation of the 

St. Vs. Inderpreet Singh Etc. FIR No. 63/12, PS Keshav Puram                         Page No. 102
 conditions of license and makes the accused  Yashwant Singh  liable for 

the offence punishable under Section 30 of Arms Act.   Therefore, I hold 

the accused Yashwant Singh guilty for the offence under  Section 30 of 

Arms Act.
(111)             Be listed for arguments on sentence on 11.4.2013.

                   Convict Yashwant Singh in Judicial Custody with Sh. Aseem 

                  Bhardwaj Advocate / Amicus Curiae. 
ORDER ON SENTENCE:
                  As per allegations in the intervening night of 14­15.3.2012 at 

about 12:10 AM at House House No. 2079/14, Ganesh Pura, Tri Nagar the 

accused Inderpreet Singh committed the murder of Harvinder Singh by 

firing upon him through a revolver which was in his possession without 

any license or permit and used the same while committing the murder of 

Harvinder Singh.  In so far as the accused Yashwant Singh is concerned it 

has been alleged that he had handed over his loaded licensee revolver to 

co­accused Inderpreet Singh who was not having any permit or license for 

the same.
                  However,   on   the   basis   of   the   testimonies   of   the   various 

witnesses   examined   by   the   prosecution   particularly   the   eye   witness 

Amolak & Gurpinder Singh and also on the basis of the medical, forensic 

and   other   circumstantial   evidence   on   record,   this   Court   vide   a   detail 

judgment dated 6.4.2013 held the accused Inderpreet Singh guilty of use 

of the firearm i.e. NP Bore Revolver / Pistol of .32 (7.65 MM) negligently 

and  casually  punishable  under  Section 304­A Indian Penal Code  (not 

under Section 302 Indian Penal Code) and also made Sections 25/27 of 

Arms Act.  Further, the accused Yashwant Singh has been held guilty of 

violating   the   conditions   of   the   license   punishable   under  Section   30   of 

Arms Act.
St. Vs. Inderpreet Singh Etc. FIR No. 63/12, PS Keshav Puram                    Page No. 105
                   Heard   arguments   on   the   point   of   sentence.     The   convict 

Inderpreet Singh is stated to be a young boy of 23 years who is running 

the family business of Spare Parts having his shop with the name of Rattan 

Auto   Sales   at   Kashmere   Gate.     The  convict   was   adopted  by  his   foster 

parents in the year 1990 from the Adoption Center 'Palna'.   Ld. Counsel 

for   the   convict   submits   that   the   convict   is   in   Judicial   Custody   since 

15.3.2012 and is not involved in any other case.  He requests that a lenient 

view be taken against the convict.
                  In so far as the convict Yashwant Singh is concerned he is an 

Ex­Serviceman aged about 47 years having a family comprising of wife, 

three daughters out of whom two are married & one is unmarried who is 

still studying and one son who is studying.   Ld. Amicus Curiae for the 

convict had vehemently argued that the convict Yashwant Singh is the sole 

bread earner of his family who are totally dependent upon him.   He has 

also argued that the convict is a first time offender .   He requests that a 

lenient view be taken against the convict Yashwant Singh.

                  On the other hand the Ld. Addl. PP for the State duly assisted 

by Sh. Jai Ram Garg Advocate for the complainant has prayed that a stern 

view be taken against the convicts since the deceased Harvinder @ Happy 

Singh was a young boy in his early twenties who was the only brother of 

five   sisters   and   sole   bread   earner   for   his   family   comprising   of   aged 

parents.     He   submits   that   no   doubt   the   convict   Inderpreet   Singh   was 

adopted   but   even   after   the   death   of   his   foster   parents,   he   is   having 

St. Vs. Inderpreet Singh Etc. FIR No. 63/12, PS Keshav Puram                     Page No. 106
 sufficient financial means and assets and is in a position to compensate the 

family of the deceased. 
                  The statement of the convict in this regard has been recorded 

separately wherein he has conceded that he is the owner of the first floor 

measuring 160 square yards at B­2, Model Town­II, Delhi which belonged 

to his deceased father late Sh. Trilochan Singh who has expired in the year 

2010 after which he is in exclusive possession of the same.   He has also 

conceded that he is running a shop of spare parts under the name and style 

of   Rattan   Auto   Sales   from   Shop   No.   2678,   Gandhi   Motor   Market, 

Kashmere Gate, Delhi which is presently closed on account of his being in 

Judicial Custody.  He further submits that he is having a bank account in 

Punjab National Bank, Kashmere Gate, Delhi in the name of the firm i.e. 

Rattan Auto Sales which bank account is solely operated by him.

                   Sh. Jai Ram Advocate for the complainant has submitted that 

the convict is deliberately trying to conceal his assets.  He has argued that 

during the trial of the case the convict while he was in custody had been 

issuing blank cheques to his counsel and it is his apprehension that on 

legal advise he has transferred a substantial amount of money from his 

declared account.  Ld. Counsel has also pointed out that apart from what 

has been stated by the convict one Ford Fiesta car bearing No. DL­3C­

AN­1539 is also in the name of the convict which he had been using.  He 

further submits that the financial capability of the convict is reflected from 

the fact that he had been maintaining a professional driver and two armed 


St. Vs. Inderpreet Singh Etc. FIR No. 63/12, PS Keshav Puram           Page No. 107
 security guards.   He further submits that the convict has tried to mislead 

the Court by claiming that he has one shop at Kashmere Gate and states 

that in fact there were two shops which were made into one which he had 

inherited from his father and the information given to the Court in this 

regard is incorrect.  
                  I   have   considered   the   submissions   made   before   me.     The 

father of the deceased Harvinder Singh @ Happy was also heard on the 

point of compensation.  I may observe that both the convicts are first time 

offender and have no criminal record.  It is evident that after the incident 

both   Inderpreet   Singh   and   Yashwant   Singh   wasted   no   time   in   rushing 

Harvinder to the hospital and did their best to save his life.  Rather, on the 

other hand it is Amolak whose conduct was highly improper.  The incident 

had taken place in his house.  He never bothered to either accompany the 

his injured childhood friend to the hospital nor inform his family or even 

the police of the same whereas on the other hand the subsequent conduct 

of Inderpreet leaves no doubt that he not only tried his best to save the life 

of   the   victim   Harvinder   but   also   did   not   try   to   run   away   or   shift   the 

liability on anybody else which he could have conveniently done but chose 

not to do.
                  It is a settled law that jurisdiction to pay compensation to the 

victim of crime / their families has to be treated as a part of the over all 

jurisdiction of the Courts and the Hon'ble Supreme Court has time and 

again impressed upon the Courts of Law to exercise this power to award 


St. Vs. Inderpreet Singh Etc. FIR No. 63/12, PS Keshav Puram                         Page No. 108
 compensation to the victim in a liberal way so that they may not have to 

rush to civil courts.   Legislation has conferred this jurisdiction upon the 

criminal courts under Section 357(3) of Code of Criminal Case at the time 

of finalization of judgment of conviction (Reference: Hari Singh Vs. State 

reported in AIR 1988 SC 2127).  
                  Compensation   is  something   given   in   recompense   i.e. 

equivalent rendered. The whole purpose of compensation is to make good 

the   loss   sustain   by   the   victim   or   legal   representative   of   the   deceased. 

Though the psychological & physical trauma / pain and sufferings of the 

family of the deceased victim cannot be compensated but for the financial 

loss caused to the aged parents of the deceased on account of the death of 

the deceased they are required to be suitably compensated.  Restitution is 

an   important   part   of   Criminal   Sentencing   which   depends   upon   the 

convict's ability to pay for the harm caused by his act to the victim and his 

family and the convict Inderpreet Singh has the financial ability to pay for 

this harm caused to the family of the victim.   
                  In   this   background   I   award   the   following   sentences   to   the 

convict Inderpreet Singh:

         Twenty Five lacs).   The entire compensation shall be given to the 

         parents of the deceased in equal proportions in default of which it 

St. Vs. Inderpreet Singh Etc. FIR No. 63/12, PS Keshav Puram                      Page No. 109
          shall be recovered from the assets of the convict in accordance with 

         law.  
    2. For the offence under  Sections 25/27 of Arms Act  the convict is
