"To call woman the weaker sex is a libel; it is man's injustice to woman. If
by strength is meant brute strength, then, indeed, is woman less brute than
man. If by strength is meant moral power, then woman is immeasurably
man's superior. Has she not greater intuition, is she not more self-
sacrificing, has she not greater powers of endurance, has she not greater
courage? Without her, man could not be. If nonviolence is the law of our
being, the future is with woman. Who can make a more effective appeal to
the heart than woman?"----Mahatma Gandhi.

10.In his statement under section 313 of the Cr.P.C., recorded on 07.04.2014
and thereafter on 25.07.2014, accused Harpreet Singh @ Sonu has
controverted and rebutted the entire evidence against him submitting that he
is innocent and he has not committed any offence. He has preferred not to
lead defence evidence.
ARGUMENTS
11.I have heard arguments at length. I have also given my conscious thought
and prolonged consideration to the material on record, relevant provisions of
law and the precedents on the point.
12.The Additional Public Prosecutor for the State has requested for convicting
the accused for having committed the offence under sections 365, 366, 342,
376, 34 and 174-A of the IPC submitting that the prosecution has been able to
bring home the charge against the accused by examining its witnesses whose
testimonies are corroborative and reliable. The accused has practically not
cross examined the prosecutrix due to which her evidence is uncontroverted.
13.The counsel for the accused, on the other hand, has requested for his
acquittal submitting that there is nothing incriminating against the accused on
the record. There is a delay in lodging of the FIR which otherwise is also
without the details. There are several contradictions in the different statements
of the prosecutrix. It is clear from the evidence of the prosecutrix that the
accused is not the culprit as she has not identified him.

DISCUSSION, ANALYSIS, OBSERVATIONS AND FINDINGS
14.The question is how to test the veracity of the prosecution story especially
when it has some variations in the evidence. Mere variance of the prosecution
story with the evidence, in all cases, should not lead to the conclusion
inevitably to reject the prosecution story. Efforts should be made to find the
truth, this is the very object for which the courts are created. To search it out,
the Courts have been removing chaff from the grain. It has to disperse the
suspicious cloud and dust out the smear as all these things clog the very truth.
So long chaff, cloud and dust remains, the criminals are clothed with this
protective layer to receive the benefit of doubt. So it is a solemn duty of the
Courts, not to merely conclude and leave the case the moment suspicions are
created. It is the onerous duty of the Court within permissible limit to find out
the truth. It means, on the other hand no innocent man should be punished but
on the other hand to see no person committing an offence should get scot-free.
If in spite of such effort suspicion is not dissolved, it remains writ at large,
benefit of doubt has to be created to the accused. For this, one has to
comprehend the totality of facts and the circumstances as spelled out through
the evidence, depending on the facts of each case by testing the credibility of
the witnesses, of course after excluding that part of the evidence which are
vague and uncertain. There is no mathematical formula through which the
truthfulness of the prosecution or a defence case could be concretized. It
would depend upon the evidence of each case including the manner of
deposition and his demeans, clarity, corroboration of witnesses and overall,
the conscience of a Judge evoked by the evidence on record. So the Courts
have to proceed further and make genuine efforts within judicial sphere to

06:00 am, she received a telephonic call from the accused. Accused informed
her that he is standing near Mother Dairy, Choukhandi, Tilak Nagar. Accused
called her at the aforesaid place. She reached there without telling anyone at
home.       Accused was standing at the said place along with his Bua -
Sukhvinder Kaur @ Sukhi (Paternal Aunt), one of his friend namely Rinku
and his brother in law Harjeet Singh. One Santro car of black colour was also
parked there. Brother in law of the accused had a talk with her and he asked
her to accompany them to Punjab where they would get her married to the
accused. She refused saying that her family was not aware about her coming
out of the house. They forcibly took her in the Santro Car to village Ladda
Munda near Mehta Chowk in Punjab.                              Harjeet Singh, brother in law of
accused got down from the car at Beas. Rest of the occupants as mentioned
above reached the village in the morning on the next day. Then she did not
see anyone except for the accused.                        The accused forcibly had physical
relations with her despite her resistance and accused told her that he would be
getting married. He also threatened to kill her family including her father and
her siblings. Accused tortured her. He forcibly had physical relations with
her 4-5 times on the same day. Next morning, his Bua Ms. Sukhvinder Kaur
@ Sukhi came there. The accused with his Bua took her to his Bua's village
i.e. Dhulka. He kept her there for 8-10 days and forcibly had physical relation
with her. Then the accused shifted her to the house of his Bua's friend in
village Timbowal. She did not know the name of his Bua's friend. There also
she was kept confined and tortured. She was not given any food. Accused
had physical relations forcibly with her there also. One aunty whose name she

sometimes. In between, when the accused was away for some marriage, she
was kept without food for two days. She kept shouting for help but nobody
came. On 04.05.2008, the accused came to meet her when she overheard
Aunty and her daughter that accused had gone for some marriage. The
accused fought with her and he had also beaten her and again forcibly had
physical relations with her. In the fight, his phone had fallen down which the
accused had not noticed. Thereafter, he left and she went to sleep. She woke
up on hearing the bell of the phone. She disconnected the line as it would have
been someone known to the accused and then telephoned her father. She told
about everything to her father. He reached there on the morning of
05.05.2008. Aunty and her daughter did not permit her father to take her back
to Delhi and then her father forcibly brought her from there against their
wishes. They reached Delhi on the morning of 06.05.2008 and her father
brought her to Police Station Tilak Nagar where her statement (Ex.PW2/A)
was recorded by the police. The police took her to DDU Hospital where she
was medically examined where her clothes and samples were taken. She was
admitted in the hospital where she remained for 5-6 days. On 08-09.05.2008,
her father had gone with the police to the house of the accused two or three
times but he was not there. The police had taken her to the Court of learned
Metropolitan Magistrate, where her statement under section 164 Cr.P.C. (Ex-
PW2/B) was recorded. She has prayed that the accused may be punished for
the offence he has committed against her. She can identify her clothes.
However, when the innerwear i.e. a blue coloured underwear was shown to
her, the prosecutrix stated that the same does not belong to her. She has
further stated that her underwear which was the lady's panty was of the

blue colour and is of very large size. In village Timbowal where she was kept
confined in the house of friend of Bua of accused Harpreet Singh, she was not
provided any food. One day, Aunty whose name she did not know but she
was friend of Bua of accused, told her that accused Harpreet had already got
married and she was not in position to do anything against him (Iski shadi ho
choki hai, tu iska kuch nahin kar sakti). She has prayed that accused may be
punished for the offence he has committed against her.
20.As the prosecutrix was hostile and had resiled from her earlier statement,
the Additional Public Prosecutor has cross-examined her.
21.In her cross examination by the Additional Public Prosecutor for State, the
prosecutrix has admitted that at the time of her medical examination, she was
asked by the doctor to hand over her underwear which she was wearing at that
time. She removed her underwear and kept the same on the table in the room
where doctor was present. She denied the suggestion that the underwear
shown to her on 31.08.2013 in this Court which had been produced by
MHCM, PS Tilak Nagar was the same underwear which was taken by doctor
from her. She denied the suggestion that she had not identified the underwear
shown to her as long time had passed.
22.She has been cross examined                     on behalf of the accused. In her cross
examination she has admitted that accused Harpreet Singh is not the same

having hair upto shoulder and small beard without mustaches. She had seen

accused Harpreet Singh for the first time in the Court room during the Court

implicated in this case. No body had asked her anything earlier. She had not
been shown accused Harpreet Singh earlier during her evidence.
23.She has been re-examined by Additional Public Prosecutor for the State. In

she had stated truth before this Hon'ble Court on that day after taking the
oath. She has admitted that she had stated everything truthfully and correctly

She and Sonu became friendly and fell in love. They used to talk on phone.
Accused Harpreet Singh @ Sonu had proposed marriage to her which was
acceptable to her but her parents did not want her to marry. On 23.02.2008,
accused Harpreet Singh @ Sonu has phoned her to come on next morning at
6.00 a.m at Chowkhandi, mother diary. When she reached there, accused
Harpreet Singh @ Sonu with her brother in law Harjeet Singh was there. A
car was also there. Her brother in law told her as she wanted to marry
accused Harpreet Singh @ Sonu, he would get her married and they should sit
in car. When she refused her brother in law, he told her not worry and he
would talk to his father on which she sat in the car.                               Ms. Sukhwinder @
Sukhi, paternal aunt (bua) of accused Harpreet Singh @ Sonu and Rinkoo
friend of accused were also sitting in the car. They took her to Punjab. Her
brother in law got down at Beas. Accused Harpreet Singh @ Sonu took her to
his house and at night he forcibly had physically relations with her despite her
refusal. He told her that now she would become his wife after marriage. She
told him that first the marriage should be done and then other things should be
done but he said that if she did not do these things, he would not marry her
and he would destroy her and her family. Then, accused Harpreet Singh @
Sonu forcibly had physical relations with her against her consent then he left
in village Dhoolka with his paternal aunt where he used to come and have
physical relations with her. Whenever, she used to ask her about marriage, he
used to avoid her. Then he took her to village Timowal where on 02.05.2008,
she came to know from his relative that he has got married to another girl. She
contacted her parents and talked to her father on 04.05.2008 and told him
everything.        Her father came in car and brought her to Delhi. Accused

26.In her statement under section 164 Cr.P.C. (Ex.PW2/B) she has stated
before Ld. MM on the lines of the complaint.
27.The Additional Public Prosecutor has submitted that the accused has not
cross examined the prosecutrix regarding all the allegations of his abducting
her, knowing that she would be compelled to marry her, or she would be
forced or seduced to illicit intercourse or knowing it to be likely that she
would be forced or seduced to illicit intercourse, wrongfully confined and
raped her and also he was declared P.O vide order dated 06.11.2009 as he was
evading his arrest. The Additional Public Prosecutror has further submitted
that athere was a gap between the examination in chief and cross examination
of the prosecutrix by the accused, the prosecutrix has given evidence in favour
of the accused in her cross examination, despite deposing against the accused
and identifying him in her examination in chief. The Additional Public
Prosecutor has referred the judgment reported as :

28.It has been argued on behalf of the accused that the prosecutrix in her cross
examination has categorically deposed that the accused is not the same person
who has committed the offence and therefore there is nothing incriminating
against him. It has been submitted on behalf of the accused that there were no

conducted on the same date i.e 26.10.2013, therefore, there was no possibility
of tampering with the evidence of the prosecutrix.
29.It is clear on perusal of the file especially the evidence of the prosecutrix
that in her examination in chief was partly recorded on 12.04.2013, she has
identified the accused. Her examination in chief was deferred as the case
property had not been produced in the Court. She was further examined in
chief partly on 31.08.2013 and her examination in chief was again deferred as
Additional Public Prosecutor wanted a clarification from the Investigation
Officer regarding the underwear of the prosecutrix. She was further examined
in chief on 26.10.2013. She was declared hostile by the prosecution since she
had not identified her underwear and was cross examined by Additional
Public Prosecutor for the State. She was subsequently cross examined by the
counsel for the accused on 26.10.2013, re-examined by Additional Public
Prosecutor and then the accused preferred not to cross examine her.
30.It is clear from the record that the prosecutrix is changing her stand
regarding identifying of the accused as in her examination in chief on
12.04.2013, she has identified him. Thereafter, in her cross examination by
the accused, she has not identified him as a culprit saying that he is not the
person who is the culprit and who had committed the offence against her. She
had seen accused Mr.Harpreet Singh @ Sonu for the first time in the Court
room during Court proceedings. The culprit was a Mona and having hair upto
shoulder and small beard without moustache. In her re-examination by the
State, she has deposed that she has stated truth on 12.04.2103 after taking
oath. However, she has denied the suggestion that she has correctly identified

the accused in the Court on 12.04.2013. It is clear that the prosecutrix is
changing her stand regarding the identification of the accused Mr.Harpreet
Singh @ Sonu in her examination in chief, cross examination by the State,
cross examination by the accused and re examination by the State.
31.Here, it would be very relevant to go through the main charge sheet when
accused Mr.Harjeet Singh was sent for trial and accused Harpreet Singh @
Sonu was a Proclaimed Offended. Accused Harjeet Singh had been acquitted
vide judgment dated 06.04.2010 of the learned Additional Session Judge -03,
West, Delhi. The file of accused Harjeet Singh is annexed with the case file
of accused Harpreet Singh @ Sonu. In her evidence recorded on 18.03.2010,
the prosecutrix had deposed on the lines of the complaint but has not assigned
criminal role to Harjeet Singh. In her statement under section 164 Cr.P.C., she
has stated before the learned Metropolitan Magistrate on the lines of the
complaint. She was cross examined by Additional Public Prosecutor in which
she has denied that on 23.02.2008, her jija asked her to come to Chaukhandi
Mother diary on 24.02.2008 at 6.00 a.m and her jija and accused Harpreet
Singh @ Sonu were present. She has also denied the suggestion that her Jija
Harjeet Singh had introduced accused Harpreet Singh @ Sonu and it was her
jija who had asked her to sit in Santro car and would make her father to
understand for getting them to married. She has denied the suggestion that she
was taken to Punjab, her jija Harjeet Singh got down at Beas.
32.In the case against accused Harjeet Singh, in evidence the prosecutrix has
not assigned any criminal role to him. He is her brother in law. She has
absolved him completely by denying that he had introduced accused Harpreet

Singh @ Sonu to her; he had come to the decided spot with accused Harpreet
Singh @ Sonu and made her sit in the car and convinced her to go with him as
he would make her family understand; he had go down at Beas. However, in
the present case, she has narrated the role of Mr.Harjeet Singh saying that he
is the brother in law of accused Harpreet Singh @ Sonu.
33.It is clear from the evidence of the prosecutrix that she is changing her
stand regarding the identity of accused. She has given a different description
of the culprit which does not match accused Harpreet Singh @ Sonu. In her
re-examination by the Additional Public Prosecutor, the prosecutrix has
denied the suggestion that she had correctly identified the accused on
12.04.2013 and she is intentionally changing her statement regarding his
identification as she has been won over by him.
34.The State has not questioned which of her evidence is correct, the one
recorded on 12.04.2013 or one recorded on 26.10.2013. In such situation, it
cannot be said that the prosecutrix is deliberately helping the accused by not
identifying her since the truthfulness of her evidence regarding the
identification of the accused recorded on 12.04.2013 has not been clarified in
her re-examination.
35.Also, her evidence regarding accused Harjeet Singh has also changed, as
elaborated above especially regarding his role in helping accused Harpreet
Singh @ Sonu abducting her; relationship of accused Harjeet Singh-as jija of
prosecutrix or jija of accused.

Under sections 365, 366, 376, 342, 493, 496,174A and 34 of the Indian Penal Code.
36.It is also clear that the prosecutrix has changed the very initial part of her
version in the prosecution story regarding accused Mr.Harjeet Singh- her
brother in law who introduced her to the accused Harpreet Singh @ Sonu and
his being there at Chowkhandi Mother Dairy and making her go with accused
Harpreet Singh @ Sonu and others to Punjab and his getting down at Beas.
37.In her evidence, in the case of accused Harjeet Singh, she has categorically
not deposed          anything regarding Harjeet Singh being the person who had
introduced accused Sonu to her and his role in the case regarding his going
along with them in a car at 6.00 a.m at Chowkhandi mother diary. However,
in her evidence before the Court in the present case of accused Harpreet Singh
@ Sonu, she has deposed that Harjeet Singh had gone with Harpreet Singh @
Sonu, her version regarding role of Harjeet Singh is also changing in different
statements.
38.When the prosecutrix has changed a very integral part of the complaint
regarding accused Harpreet Singh, in the evidence dated 18.03.2010 in the
case against accused Harjeet Singh when accused Harpreet Singh @ Sonu was
PO, and in her evidence dated 12.04.2013, after the arrest of accused Harpreet
Singh @ Sonu. When one part of her complaint is changed then the second
part can not be said to reliable. When the beginning part of the prosecution
story regarding the role of accused Harjit Singh is not supported by the
prosecutrix, then later part of her complaint cannot be believed. In fact, in the
evidence dated 18.03.2010 in the case against accused Harjeet Singh when
accused Harpreet Singh @ Sonu was PO, the prosecutrix has not assigned any
criminal role to accused Harjeet Singh. She has only deposed that he is

married to her sister and she does not any of his friends. The prosecution
cannot take advantage of one part of her evidence and ignore the other. The
evidence of the prosecutrix in totality has to be taken into consideration.
When she says on 18.03.2010 that accused Harjeet Singh, her brother in law,
has not done anything then her evidence on 12.04.2013 also has to indicate
that accused Harjeet Singh, brother in law of the accused, also has not done
anything.
39.Further, her evidence regarding identification of accused Harpreet Singh @
Sonu has also changed. The prosecution has not been able to show that one of
the depositions of the prosecutrix regarding her identifying accused Harpreet
Singh @ Sonu is correct.
40.Further, it can be seen that the version which the prosecutrix has given in
her examination in chief on 12.04.2013, 31.08.2013 and 26.10.2013 is too far
fetched and cannot be believable. She leaves her house without telling anyone
on 24.02.2008 and meets accused Harpreet Singh @ Sonu at 06:00 am at
Chaukhandi Mother Dairy who has come in a Santro car with His Bua
Ms.Sukhvinder Kaur @ Sukhi and friend Mr.Rinku and she goes with them
without any resistance. She did not shout for help or raise alarm during her
travel to Punjab. Even when accused Harpreet Singh @ Sonu committed rape
upon her saying that he will marry her or when he threatened to destroy her
family or when he got married to another girl, she still did not shout for help
or raise alarm. She suddenly managed to have access to the mobile phone of
the accused and contacted her father who came to Punjab and picked her up
from ATM. This would indicate that the prosecutrix was free to move about

in Punjab otherwise she could not have gone to the ATM. She has also not
identified the underwear produced in the Court. All these facts throw a doubt
on the version projected in the complaint (Ex.PW2/A) and her evidence. Her
evidence does not appear to be believable and reliable.
41.The judgments relied upon by the prosecution are not applicable to the
given facts. The same elucidate the principle that evidence of a hostile witness
can be relied upon when there is a gap between the examination in chief and
the cross examination as the witness is won over in the meanwhile. In the
present case, although there is a gap between the examination in chief
recorded on 12.04.2013 and the cross examination on 26.10.2013 but the
judgments do not help as the evidence of the prosecutrix, itself is not
believable, reliable and trust worthy, as discussed above. It is not worthy of
credence and does not inspire confidence.
42.The Additional Public Prosecutor has referred to the application for bail of
the accused which was filed on 26.08.2013, para 6 to 8 submitting that
accused Harpreet Singh @ Sonu has admitted having physical relations with
the prosecutrix and therefore, it cannot be said that he is not a man who is the
culprit, although the prosecutrix in his examination has said that accused
present in the Court is not the culprit and has not committed offence against
her.
43.However, the submission of Additional Public Prosecutor regarding the
contents of the bail application filed on 26.08.2013 do not effect the merits of
the case and the same is only in the bail application and it is the evidence

which is the material and which is to be considered. Even otherwise, the case
of the prosecution has to stand on its own legs and cannot take advantage of
his weakness in the defence.
44.It is clear from the evidence of the prosecutrix that she is changing her
stand regarding the identity of accused Harpreet Singh @ Sonu and the role of
accused Harjeet Singh as well as her relationship with him. In such situation,
it cannot be said that the prosecutrix is deliberately helping the accused
Harpreet Singh @ Sonu by not identifying him since the truthfulness of her
evidence recorded on 12.04.2013 have not been clarified.
45.The father of the prosecutrix has deposed that the prosecutrix was having
affair with boy named Sonu and he suspected that she may have gone with
him. He had overheard her talking on the phone with the boy. After 2 ½
months of his daughter missing from house he had received missed call on
mobile phone of unknown number. After sometime, he made call from his
mobile phone and it was picked up by his daughter. She told him that she
was somewhere in Punjab near Amritsar and asked him to take her back.
Next day, he alongwith his nephew Mr. Amarjeet went to Amritsar (Punjab)
where his daughter was present near ATM in a village at a distance of about
20-25 Km from Amritsar and he brought her back. As she was not well and
was admitted in DDU hospital. He also informed the police regarding the
admission of his daughter. He was declared hostile by the prosecution and in
his cross examination by the Additional Public Prosecutor, he has admitted
that the complaint dated 24.02.2008 Mark X and has also admitted the facts in
the said complaint. He has also admitted that his daughter was insisting them

that they should marry her with one Mr. Sonu who is resident of Punjab and
with whom she was in love. The police had recorded his statement but his
statement in writing was not recorded by the police in his presence. He has
denied the contents of his statement (Ex. PW7/B).
46.Here it may also be mentioned that father of the prosecutrix was examined
as PW7 in trial of accused Harjeet Singh and father of the prosecutrix was
declared hostile in his cross examination by the State. He has deposed that
the police had recorded his statement but he has denied the contents of his
statement.
47.Here it may also be mentioned that there is no medical or forensic
evidence to connect accused Harpreet Singh @ Sonu to the crime. The
evidence of the other witnesses including the doctors, official and formal
witnesses is not required to be discussed as the evidence of the prosecutrix
itself is neither reliable nor trustworthy not believable.
48.The veracity of the testimony of the prosecutrix, as mentioned in her
examination in chief, is shattered in her cross examination, which makes it
highly improbable that such incidents, as alleged by her, ever occurred. The
prosecution has failed to furnish any explanation in respect of the
contradictions in the statements of the prosecutrix. The inherent contradictions
strike at the very root of the prosecution story making it unbelievable and
improbable. In the instant case, the evidence and different statements of the
victim/prosecutrix suffers from such infirmities and the probabilities due to
which the prosecution has come out with a story, which is highly improbable.

The overwhelming contradictions are too major to be ignored and they strike a
fatal blow to the prosecution version. In fact what emerges from the evidence
of the prosecutrix is that the prosecution case against the accused is false.
49.The prosecutrix has changed the very foundation of the prosecution
version, as elaborated in her complaint / statement (Ex.PW2/A) regarding the
role of accused Harjeet Singh and his relationship with her. When a fatal blow
is given to the inherent story, then the remaining part also becomes
unbelievable. When the evidence of the prosecutrix is not trustworthy
regarding accused Harjeet Singh, it cannot be trustworthy regarding accused
Harpreet Singh @ Sonu. She has also given different versions in her
complaint, evidence on 18.03.2010 and evidence of 12.04.2013, 31.08.2013
and 26.10.2013. She has not identified the underwear produced in the Court.

50.The testimony of the prosecutrix is full of contradictions and it is not
corroborated by other evidence on record. In such a situation, the accused
becomes entitled to be acquitted. Reliance can be placed upon the judgment
reported as Om Prakash alias Kalia v. State, 2011 (1) JCC 391.
51.Therefore, it cannot be said that the accused Harpreet Singh @ Sonu had
abducted the prosecutrix, confined her, raped her or threatened her. On careful
perusal of the evidence of the prosecutrix it transpires that there are several
overwhelming contradictions and inconsistencies are revealed in her different
statements which give a shattering blow to the case.

52.The prosecution has failed to furnish any explanation in respect of the
contradictions in the statements of the prosecutrix. The inherent contradictions
strike at the very root of the prosecution story making it unbelievable and
improbable. In the instant case, the evidence and different statements of the
victim/prosecutrix suffers from such infirmities and the probabilities due to
which the prosecution has come out with a story, which is highly improbable.
The overwhelming contradictions are too major to be ignored and they strike a
fatal blow to the prosecution version. In fact what emerges from the evidence
of the prosecutrix is she has leveled false allegations of threat, rape and
blackmail against the accused.
53.In the light of the aforesaid nature of deposition of the prosecutrix (PW2)
who happens to be the material witnesses, I am of the considered view that her
deposition cannot be treated as trustworthy and reliable. Reliance can also be
placed upon the judgment reported as Suraj Mal versus The State (Delhi
Admn.), AIR 1979 S.C. 1408, wherein it has been observed by the Supreme
Court as:

55.In the judgment reported as Namdeo Daulata Dhayagude and others v.
State of Maharashtra, AIR 1977 SC 381, it was held that where the story
narrated by the witness in his evidence before the Court differs substantially
from that set out in his statement before the police and there are large number
of contradictions in his evidence not on mere matters of detail, but on vital
points, it would not be safe to rely on his evidence and it may be excluded
from consideration in determining the guilt of accused.

Administration) AIR 1979, SC 1408, it was held that where witnesses make
two inconsistent statements in their evidence either at one stage or at two
stages, the testimony of such witnesses becomes unreliable and unworthy of
credence and in the absence of special circumstances no conviction can be
based on the evidence of such witnesses.
57.In the judgment reported as Devu Samal v. The State, 2012 (2) JCC
1039, it was held that the contradictory testimony of the prosecutrix not
supported by the FSL report makes it a fit case of grant of benefit of doubt to
the petitioner.
58.Consequently, no inference can be drawn that the accused is guilty of the
charged offences as the prosecutrix has made different inconsistent statements
due to which her testimony becomes unreliable and unworthy of credence.

infirmities and inconsistencies with other material and there being no forensic

or medical evidence, then no reliance can be placed upon her evidence. Onus
is always on the prosecution to prove and accused is entitled to the benefit of
reasonable doubt. Case of the prosecution is to be proved beyond reasonable
doubt and cannot take support from weakness of case of defence. In case the
evidence is read in totality and story projected by the prosecutrix is found to
be improbable, prosecution case becomes liable to be rejected. If evidence of
prosecutrix is read and considered in totality of circumstances along with
other evidence on record, in which offence is alleged to have been committed,
her deposition does not inspire confidence. Prosecution has not disclosed true
genesis of crime. (Reliance can be placed upon the judgment of the hon'ble
Supreme Court reported as Narender Kumar v. State (NCT of Delhi), 2012
(5) LRC 137 (SC).
60.If one integral part of the story put forth by a witness-prosecutrix was not
believable, then entire case fails. Where a witness makes two inconsistent
statements in evidence either at one stage or both stages, testimony of such
witness becomes unreliable and unworthy of credence and in the absence of
special circumstances, no conviction can be based on such evidence. (Reliance
can be placed upon the judgment of the hon'ble Delhi High Court reported as
Ashok Narang v. State, 2012 (2) LRC 287 (Del).
61.Consequently, no inference can be drawn that the accused is guilty of the
charged offences that he had abducted, confined, threatened and raped the

her testimony becomes unreliable and unworthy of credence. There is no
material on record that the accused committed any offence against the

Under sections 365, 366, 376, 342, 493, 496,174A and 34 of the Indian Penal Code.
62.Consequently, accused Mr.Harpreet Singh @ Sonu merits to be
acquitted of the offences under sections 365/34, 366/34, 342 and 376 of
the IPC as the prosecution has failed to bring home the charge for the
said offences.
SECTION 174 A OF THE IPC
63.The prosecution case is that accused Harpreet Singh @ Sonu was
absconding and evading his arrest and not making himself for investigation
due to which he was declared a Proclaimed Offender vide order dated
06.11.2009 of the Court of Mr. Mahinder Virat, learned Metropolitan
Magistrate, THC, Delhi. Subsequently, accused Mr. Harpreet Singh @ Sonu
was arrested and produced on 03.11.2014 vide kalandra under section 41.1.(c)
of the Cr.P.C. and the supplementary chargesheet was filed against him on
17.01.2013.
64.In order to prove this charge, the prosecution has examined PW15-
Insp.Kamal Singh, PW16-HC Anil Kumar, PW17-HC Mahabir Singh, PW19-
Ct.Sunnil Kumar, PW20-Retired SI Jassa Singh and PW21-SI Basant Kumar.
The accused and his counsel have preferred not to cross examine PWs 16 and
19 due to which their evidence remains uncontroverted and unrebutted and
can be presumed to have been admitted as correct by the accused.
65.Insp Kamal Singh has proved that he moved an application before the Ld.
Concerned MM of PS Tilak Nagar on 11.12.2008 for obtaining the NBWs

against accused Harpreet Singh @ Sonu. The same was allowed and the raid
was conducted several times at Punjab for apprehending accused Harpreet
Singh but he was not found at the given address.                               He accordingly also
obtained the process under section 82 and 83 Cr. P.C against the accused
Harpreet Singh @ Sonu. SI Jassa Singh has proved that accused Harpreet
Singh @ Sonu was declared a Proclaimed Offender on 06.11.2009.
Thereafter, he was arrested by the PO staff by PWs 16 and 19 from his native
village vide arrest memo (Ex.PW16/A) and his personal search was taken
vide personal search memo (Ex.PW16/B). He was brought to Delhi, got
medically examined and kalandra (Ex.PW16/C) was presented.
66.Thereafter, PWs 17 and 21 arrested accused Harpreet Singh @ Sonu in the
Court vide arrest memo (Ex.PW17/A) and he made a disclosure
(Ex.PW17/B).
67.Although PW20, in his cross examination has admitted that the family
members of the accused informed him that accused was not available as he
had gone out of country but this deposition does not help the accused as he
still did not make himself available for investigation even after his family
members were aware about the present case.
68.It is clear on perusal of the record that accused Mr. Harpreet Singh @ Sonu
was declared Proclaimed Offender vide order dated 06.11.2009, subsequently
arrested on 03.11.2012, kalandra presented and he has been chargesheeted for
offences including under section 174 (A) of the Indian Penal Code.

Under sections 365, 366, 376, 342, 493, 496,174A and 34 of the Indian Penal Code.
69.The prosecution has successfully proved that the accused Harpreet Singh
@ Sonu was evading his arrest and absconding. Even despite issuance of
NBWs and process under sections 82 and 83 Cr.P.C., he did not make himself
available due to which he was Proclaimed Offender. The accused has not led
any evidence in his defence to counter his being declared P.O.
70.Therefore, it is clear that prosecution has been able to successfully
prove that accused Mr. Harpreet Singh @ Sonu was declared
Proclaimed Offender as he was evading his arrest and he is guilty under
section 174 A of the IPC.
CONCLUSION
71.Since the prosecutrix as PW2 is neither reliable nor believable as there are
overwhelming contradictions in her different statements, and the above
discussion, the conscience of this Court is completely satisfied that the
prosecution has not been able to bring home the charge against the accused for
the offences under sections 365/34, 366/34, 342 and 376 of the IPC. The
prosecution story does not inspire confidence and is not worthy of credence
regarding the offences under sections 365/34, 366/34, 342 and 376 of the IPC.
72.From the above discussion, it is clear that the evidence of the prosecution
is neither reliable nor believable and is not trustworthy regarding the veracity
of the prosecution case and the prosecution has failed to establish abduction,
confinement, rape and threat by the accused Harpreet Singh @ Sonu. The
gaps in the prosecution evidence, the several discrepancies in the evidence and
other circumstances make it highly improbable that such an incident ever took

Under sections 365, 366, 376, 342, 493, 496,174A and 34 of the Indian Penal Code.
73.However, the prosecution has been able to successfully prove its case
under section 174 A of the IPC against Harpreet Singh @ Sonu.
74.In the case of Sharad Birdhichand Sarda v. State of Maharastra, AIR
1984 SC 1622, the Apex Court has laid down the tests which are prerequisites
before conviction should be recorded, which are as under:
i.The circumstances from which the conclusion of guilt is to be drawn
should be fully established. The circumstances concerned 'must or should'
and not 'may be' established;
ii.The facts so established should be consistent onlywith the hypothesis of
the guilt of the accused, that is to say, they should not be explainable on
any other hypothesis except that the accused is guilty;
iii.The circumstances should be of conclusive nature and tendency;
iv.They should exclude every possible hypothesis except the one to be
proved; and
v.There must be a chain of evidence so complete as not to leave any
reasonable ground for the conclusion consistent with the innocence of the
accused and must show that in all human probability the act must have
been done by the accused.
75.Applying the above principles of law to the facts of present case, it is
evident that the identity of the accused Mr.Harapreet Singh @ Sonu is not
established as of the culprit. It also stands established that the accused had not
abducted, confined and raped the prosecutrix. There is no medical or forensic
or circumstantial evidence to show that such an offence has ever been
committed. There is no incriminating evidence against the accused. The gaps
in the prosecution evidence, the several discrepancies in the evidence and
other circumstances make it highly improbable that such an incident ever took
place.

Under sections 365, 366, 376, 342, 493, 496,174A and 34 of the Indian Penal Code.
  1. In pursuance of judgment dated 27.07.2015 of by this Court acquitting
         the accused Mr. Harpreet Singh @ Sonu under sections 365/34, 366/34,
         342 and 376 of the Indian Penal Code(hereinafter referred to as the
         IPC) and convicting the accused namely Mr. Harpreet Singh @ Sonu
         for offences punishable under sections 174 A of the Indian Penal Code
         (hereinafter referred to as the IPC), I have heard the Additional Public
         Prosecutor for the State as well as the Substitute Additional Public
         Prosecutor for the State and the counsel for the convict as well as the
         convict on the point of quantum of sentence to be awarded to the
         convict and also perused the case record.
    2.    The Additional Public Prosecutor for the State has requested, on
         27.07.2015, and the Substitute Additional Public Prosecutor has
         requested today i.e. on 28.07.2015, for the maximum sentence to be
         imposed upon the convict submitting that he does not deserve any
         leniency keeping in view the offence committed by him as he had
         absconded and was evading his arrest due to which he was declared
         Proclaimed Offender.
    3. The convict, on the other hand, has requested for a lenient view to be
         taken against him and for his release on probation as the convict hails
         from a modest family. The convict has submitted that he is aged about
         27 years and is married with two children and his aged parents are also
         living with him. He is presently not working although he was earlier

         selling fertilizers, seeds etc. He was in custody w.e.f. 03.11.2012 to
         25.11.2013. He is a first offender and has never committed any offence
         earlier. It is also submitted that he shall not commit any offence in
         future.
    4. Considering the aforesaid submissions from both the sides, the family
         circumstances of the convict and perusing the case record, I consider it
         proper to award a substantive sentence upon the convict as he had
         absconded during investigation due to which he was declared a
         Proclaimed Offender.
    5. Keeping in view the offence committed by the convict, I am inclined to
         take a lenient view against him and release him by giving him simple
         imprisonment for the period he has already remained in custody i.e.
         w.e.f 03.11.2012 to 25.11.2013 and the benefit of section 428 Cr. PC is
         granted to him.

         already remained in custody i.e. w.e.f 03.11.2012 to 25.11.2013 and
